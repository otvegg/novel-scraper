Chapter 1: Transmigration (1)

The wind was icy and sharp, making it feel like blades cutting through the air. Snowflakes were swirling and falling to the ground, creating a white blanket all around.

Lu Zhen opened his eyes and found himself seated in a luxurious carriage.

Outside the carriage, there was a lively chaos. Street sellers called out their goods, people chattered and fought, and children made noise and played.

Lu zhen heaved a deep sigh.

"Looks like I have really transmigrated to this world."

He knew he couldn't go back to his own blue planet. He was originally a computer programmer who has just got his job at a big company but when he was celebrating he got too drunk.

The next moment he knew he found himself in this guy body in this unfamiliar world.

Having been an avid reader of novels, Lu Zhen was familiar with the concept of transmigration. After a full day of despair, he reluctantly came to terms with his new circumstances. All the hard work and effort he had put into securing his prestigious job as a computer programmer had gone to waste.

And besides that he found these world was full of danger with martial arts being primary here and dangerous beasts and ghosts roaming around.

He still remained hopeful about his future. After all, transmigrators usually get a system, and he did get a system. The moment he transmigrated, he received his system. The blue panel in front of him gave him the confidence to survive in this world.

"Now, let's see what this system can do," Lu Zhen thought, examining the panel. The words "LEVEL UP" were displayed in bold letters.

"Well, 'Level Up,' that must be its name," he mused. "Even though the system seems straightforward, I'm still excited. Regardless of how simple the cheat may be, I'll still have an advantage over others, won't I?"

The panel before him seemed plain.

The panel had lots of information, but it was vague. It made him curious about his true capabilities. Questions about the system and how to level up and acquire new abilities filled his mind.

As he pondered over several conjectures, trying to make sense of his current situation and the potential ways to progress within this system.

While lost in his thoughts, the carriage suddenly came to a halt, interrupting his thoughts.

"Young master, we have arrived at the estate," a deep and old voice resonated as the carriage came to a halt.

Lu Zhen got out of the carriage and was met with the sight of a stunning mansion. It was decorated with red lanterns, emanating an extravagant and spacious atmosphere.

"Yu Bai, you can go and take some rest. You don't have to accompany me," Lu Zhen said.

Yu Bai, an elderly man in his eighties, was the personal guard of his assigned by his mother and had taken care of Lu Zhen since his childhood.

"But young master, I insist on staying by your side. It's my duty to serve you," Yu Bai protested.

"I appreciate your loyalty, Yu Bai, but I need some time alone," Lu Zhen replied firmly.

Yu Bai was slightly taken aback by Lu Zhen's words, as he had never experienced such kindness from him before. Nevertheless, he couldn't help but feel a sense of happiness, believing that all his hard work had finally paid off and caught Lu Zhen's attention. After all, he was frail and weak, barely a third stage martial artist who was ageing in Lu Zhen's eyes.

"Thank you, young master. I won't be far if you need me," Yu Bai said, his voice filled with gratitude.

After leaving Yu Bai, Lu Zhen made his way towards the backyard. As he arrived, Little Lily, his personal servant, leaped towards him with excitement.

"Young master, you're back! Madam and master were so worried about you." Little Lily exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with relief.

Lu Zhen smiled warmly at her. "Thank you for letting them know I'm safe, Lily. I appreciate your concern."

Little Lily, who was 18 years old, shared the same age as Lu Zhen. She possessed a petite yet well-proportioned figure, with curves in all the right places. Her lustrous blue hair was elegantly tied up in a bun, adorned with a charming hair ornament.

Little Lily embraced Lu Zhen, and he could feel her curves, which stirred a slight arousal within him. As a former virgin, his lack of experience with women was apparent. He had focused primarily on his career in his previous life and had little interaction with the opposite sex.

Relationships and romantic pursuits had held little interest for him compared to his drive for success.

"I couldn't bear to see them so worried, young master. I'm just glad you're back unharmed," she replied, her voice filled with genuine care.

Lu Zhen noticed the elegant hair ornament and couldn't help but compliment her. "That hair ornament looks beautiful on you, Lily. It suits you perfectly."

Blushing slightly, Little Lily thanked him. "Thank you, young master. It's a gift from Madam. She thought it would bring me good luck."

"Well, it certainly does. You always bring good luck to me," Lu Zhen said with a playful grin.

Little Lily giggled, her cheeks turning a deeper shade of red. "Young master, you always know how to make me smile."

Lu Zhen's heart warmed at her genuine happiness. In this unfamiliar world, Little Lily's presence provided him with a sense of familiarity and comfort.

"Sigh, Little Lily, I have contemplated my situation, and I am determined to change my destiny by wholeheartedly practicing martial arts," Lu Zhen conveyed with a sigh.

This was a cover-up Lu Zhen made, he wanted to disguise his sudden change in temperament.

In the entire town, he had gained infamy for his lazy lifestyle and heavy drinking habits. The previous host of his body had given up on any ambitions, content with squandering his wealth and living a life of leisure.

Lu Zhen refused to settle for a mediocre life.

He has faced the life of an ordinary in his previous life which was filled with humiliation and bowing to almost everyone in the blue planet. So, he had always craved power and authority, but his averageness held him back.

However, in this new world, a glimmer of hope emerged. With the cheat in his possession, he believed that he held the key to unlock limitless possibilities. After all, cheats were not named cheats for no reason.

Little Lily was taken aback by Lu Zhen's declaration. After all, he had always been known for his laziness. However, with her pure heart and unwavering trust, she didn't doubt his sudden change of behavior.

"Young master, should I inform madam and master that you have decided to pursue martial arts?" Little Lily asked, her voice brimming with excitement.

Lu Zhen paused for a moment before replying, "Hmm, I will personally inform them about my situation, so there's no need for you to worry. But for now, let's focus on my training. I have a long way to go, and every moment counts."

When he first transmigrated, Lu Zhen felt disoriented and fearful.

Memories from his new body's previous host flooded his mind, but they were fragmented and incomplete. In order to adjust to his new body and identity, he took the opportunity to travel for a day, using the excuse of needing fresh air.

He was especially cautious when it came to encountering his biological parents, afraid that they might uncover the truth about his transmigration.

After all, no matter how much he tried to white-wash his actions, he had indeed taken over someone else's body. Although their names were the same, Lu Zhen still chose to distance himself from them for the time being.

"Prepare some food for me. I'll be there in a minute," he instructed Little Lily, signaling his need for food.

Chapter 2: Transmigration (2)

"Hmm, now that I've gathered my thoughts, it's finally time to focus on the system," Lu Zhen thought to himself as he sat cross-legged in his room.

He extended his hand towards the blue panel, and as he expected, his hand passed right through it.

However, he just noticed that the system panel opened and closed at his command, granting him access to its features. Excited by this newfound ability, Lu Shen began to experiment with the system's functions.

His first experiment involved the notion of gaining experience and levelling up by killing living beings, a common theme in the novels he had read.

As a mosquito buzzed past Lu Zhen, it landed on his hand. Annoyed by the persistent insect, Lu Zhen reacted swiftly. Without a second thought, he slapped his hand down, crushing the mosquito in one swift motion.

A resounding clap filled the air as Lu Zhen's palm collided with his own skin. The impact echoed throughout his room. The lifeless body of the mosquito lay flattened against his hand, a small smear of its remains left behind.

Lu Zhen's eyes remained fixed upon the lifeless insect, a mixture of anticipation and hope welling up within him. He glanced at his system, hoping to see some signs of progress or an increase in experience points.

To his disappointment, the system remained unchanged, unaffected by the mosquito's death. No notifications or advancements appeared on the blue panel.

"What? That's it?" Lu Zhen exclaimed in frustration. He had hoped that this simple act would yield some tangible results, but it seemed he was mistaken.

The realization hit him that this world might not adhere to the rules he had come to expect from the novels he had read. Killing alone may not be enough to gain experience or level up.

Sighing in resignation, Lu Zhen decided to reassess his approach. He would need to gather more information and experiment further to understand the intricacies of this new system and how it operated in this unfamiliar world.

"Looks like it won't be as straightforward as I thought," he muttered to himself.

Lu Zhen tried every method he knew from the novels to level up, but to his despair, none of them seemed to work in this new world. Frustrated and seeking a breakthrough, his mind was consumed with calculations and strategies.

Amidst his thoughts, his stomach growled loudly, reminding him of his hunger. The meagre meal of bread and butter he had eaten in the carriage did little to satisfy his appetite. Now, his hunger became more intense, urging him to find a proper meal.

That's why he had instructed his maid to prepare some food for him. After all, Lu Zhen was truly hungry. He had spent the entire day lost in thought, sitting around with only bread and butter from the carriage to rely on.

If it was the previous greenhouse spoiled brat, the previous host of this body, he would probably be in despair right now if he only survived one whole day by only relying on bread and butter.

Lu Zhen thought to himself, "She should have prepared the food." He realized that being hungry was hindering his ability to think, and he needed a clear mind to figure out how he levelled up using his cheat.

As Lu Zhen left his room, the fragrant smell of food drifted to his nose. The food before him consisted of rice, meat, pulses, and soup, and its enticing aroma captivated his senses. Lu Zhen's eyes glazed over, drawn towards the mouthwatering scent.

Little Lily, seeing Lu Zhen, was taken aback. "Young master, I was about to call you..."

Lu Zhen paid no mind to Little Lily's words, completely entranced by the food in front of him. With a hypnotized, dazed expression, he walked his way towards the enticing feast.

Grabbing the bowl, Lu Zhen filled it with rice and urgently took a large bite with his bare hands. Instantly, warm energy coursed through every part in his body, granting him a subtle physical enhancement, although with some energy wastage.

The warm energy brought a sense of delight to Lu Zhen, encouraging him to grab a chicken leg and take a small bite. Once again, he felt the surge of warmth infusing his body, heightening his excitement.

As Lu Zhen devoured his meal, Little Lily stood by, observing his ravenous appetite. Her thoughts raced as she watched him eat like there was no tomorrow. She couldn't help but be astonished at the sight before her.

"Wow, I've never seen the young master eat like this," she thought to herself, her eyebrows furrowing slightly. "He's usually so picky and reserved when it comes to food. But I suppose it makes sense. After all, he must have eaten less when he was travelling by carriage."

Lu Zhen remained oblivious to Little Lily's thoughts, and even if he were aware, he wouldn't have cared. After all, she was merely his personal servant, bound to him as if she were a slave. Unlike Yu Bai, who held a higher position as a family servant, Little Lily's opinion or suspicions held little importance to him.

With an abyss like appetite, Lu Zhen devoured the food like there was no tomorrow. Time passed as he consumed every last piece of food as he finished his last piece of meat his stomach protruded slightly. He had eaten to his heart's content, his body now full and unable to take another bite.

[You have eaten the food to the limits of your current body limit.]

[You have acquired the gluttony skill.]

Lu Zhen's eyes widened in surprise. He had unlocked a new skill through his excessive eating.

"So, I can acquire skills by fulfilling certain conditions huh‚Ä¶" he thought, his curiosity piqued.

In an instant, his body absorbed the previously wasted energy, restoring his belly to its normal state.

Lu Zhen was even more ecstatic to see that these gluttony skill was helpful and practical already.

Lu Zhen felt a surge of excitement as he contemplated the conditions for obtaining different skills.

"I wonder if fulfilling certain conditions can also grant me new attributes," he pondered.

With his mind set on exploring this possibility, Lu Zhen instructed Little Lily, "I will be training in my room for the next two days. Leave the food outside the door."

Little Lily was taken aback by her young master's newfound determination. She had always known him to have a small appetite, but now he seemed capable of consuming an entire meal.

As Little Lily observed his unwavering determination, she couldn't help but be amazed by her young master's transformation. It seemed that he was genuinely dedicated to his pursuit of martial arts, surprising her greatly.

Even if Lu Zhen wasn't innately talented, he had the vast resources available to him as a member of the Lu family, there was no doubt that he had the potential to become a formidable powerhouse in the future.

Although she had been initially content with her young master, deep down, Little Lily couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment in Lu Zhen's laziness. With the abundant resources at his disposal, Lu Zhen had the potential to become a formidable martial artist with minimal effort. However, he seemed to lack the motivation to practise and improve before.

Now, seeing his newfound determination, Little Lily couldn't help but entertain a thought that made her cheeks flush slightly. She knew her place as a personal servant, and while Lu Zhen had never made any advances towards her, as a personal maid her destiny was to be a bed warmer of Lu Zhen.

Chapter 3: Constitution

As Lu Zhen returned to his room to continue his cultivation, he began to ponder about the abilities of his system. He had observed that skills could be acquired by fulfilling certain conditions, and this led him to make an assumption that attribute levels could also be increased in a similar manner.

However, it was merely an assumption he came up with on the spot. He still needed to verify it and the question remained: How could he meet the specific conditions to level up his attributes?

Among the attributes, the one he found easiest to comprehend was constitution. Lu Zhen believed that the constitution represented the overall strength and vitality of the body.

To improve his constitution, Lu Zhen decided to start with a simple exercise: push-ups.

With decisiveness, Lu Zhen positioned himself on the floor. He placed his hands firmly on the ground, shoulder-width apart, and straightened his body from head to toe.

He took a deep breath and lowered his body towards the ground, feeling the strain on his muscles. His arms trembled a little, but he pushed through the discomfort and increased the number of push-ups he did.

As he continued, sweat started to form on his forehead, reflecting the soft light in the room. His controlled breaths filled the air, accompanied by the faint sound of his muscles working.

As Lu Zhen continued his push-ups, he soon reached his limit by doing 190 repetitions.

Despite the discomfort and muscle soreness, Lu Zhen remained determined to push himself further. He continued doing push-ups, feeling the strain on his muscles intensify. Every repetition brought him closer to his goal.

His muscles began to ache, and the pain seemed almost unbearable. However, Lu Zhen's unwavering resolve propelled him forward. He refused to succumb to the pain, knowing that pain is the ladder to success.

With sheer willpower, he persevered, completing the final 200 push-ups.

As a surge of energy coursed through his body, a renewed vitality enveloped him. He felt his muscles pulsate with power, as if he were the ruler of this world. The sensation of strength and vigor filled every fiber of his being.

In the corner of his vision, a notification from his system appeared, catching his attention.

[You have exceeded your body limit.]

[Constitution has levelled up from level 4 to level 5.]

Lu Zhen's face lit up with satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. He had successfully tested his theory.

Looks like he could indeed level up if he met certain conditions.

However he didn't know how to increase other attributes. Maybe charm needed him to do make up? He didn't know much about anything so he decided to first max out his constitution to the limits first.

With renewed vigor, Lu Zhen began his push-up routine once again. Time seemed to slip away as he dedicated himself to the exercise, pushing his body to its limit.

As he reached his limit, a warm surge of energy coursed through his veins, revitalizing his body and making him feel invigorated. The appearance of a system prompt in the corner of his vision brought a sense of excitement and fulfilment.

[You have reached your body's limit.]

[Your constitution has levelled up from level 5 to level 6.]

A wave of accomplishment washed over him, filling him with pride for the hard work he had put in and the rewards he had earned.

Realizing the strain in his muscles, Lu Zhen wisely decided to take a break from his push-up session. He understood the importance of avoiding injury and didn't want to push himself too hard, despite feeling stronger with the warm energy.

Feeling the heat emanating from his exerted body, he removed his black-coloured gown. His room contained a large mirror, from the previous owner of his body who had been quite narcissistic. Reflecting on this fact, Lu Zhen couldn't help but let a bitter smile grace his lips.

When Lu Zhen caught a glimpse of his shirtless body reflection in the mirror, he couldn't help but be amazed by his transformed physique. His body now boasted defined six-pack abs, and though he was still lean, his muscles exuded a sense of power.

Examining his appearance, Lu Zhen took note of his handsome face with red eyes, black hair, and well-defined features. He couldn't deny that he looked good, even more so with the added physical enhancements he had gained through his cheat.

Lu Zhen swiftly changed his clothes and made his way outside to indulge in the delicious food that awaited him. As he arrived, Little Lily greeted him with excitement.

"Young master, I have prepared the food for you, and the bath is ready." She said eagerly.

Lu Zhen affectionately patted Little Lily's head, causing a faint blush to rise on her cheeks. "Good job, Lily." he murmured, his tone slow and flirtatious. His words whispered seductively into her ear, leaving her face completely flushed with embarrassment.

The previous host had one good quality: he liked to bathe every day. Lu Zhen was naturally pleased with this, but he didn't want to bathe in hot water.

"Little Lily, prepare my bath with cold water."

"Yes, young master." Little Lily responded while blushing.

"I will go prepare the bath with cold water," Little Lily said, her voice filled with embarrassment, as she hurriedly went to make the necessary arrangements.

Lu Zhen felt a sense of contentment with himself. Being a former virgin and still a virgin, he still had it in him to make girl blush.

Little Lily who was sneakingly looked at Lu Zhen.

"Young master has become more handsome for some reason..." She thought as her face was rosy red already.

With a satisfied expression, Lu Zhen finished his meal, feeling a surge of energy coursing through his body once again.

He couldn't help but notice that this time, he absorbed the energy from the food more efficiently than before with almost no wastage to any of that warm mysterious energy.

"Looks like this new skill I got increases my metabolism," he mused, intrigued by the unexpected enhancement.

With that thought, Lu Zhen wasted no time and quickly proceeded to take a cold-water bath.

Chapter 4: Constitution (2)

As Lu Zhen entered the bathroom, he was greeted by a spacious room with a bathtub that resembled a swimming pool. Little Lily was diligently adding cold water to the tub.

Slowly, Lu Zhen undressed, revealing his toned physique with defined muscles and a visible six-pack. Little Lily couldn't help but be astonished at the transformation in his body. In just a day, he had gone from being relatively thin to becoming muscular.

Although she was a little suspicious but she was too distracted by Lu Zhen physique that she didn't think much about it.

As Lu Zhen undressed and stepped into the cold water, a refreshing sensation enveloped his body. The cool temperature stimulated his blood cells, leaving him feeling more alert and rejuvenated.

"A cold shower in the winter is the best‚Ä¶."

Lu Zhen thought as he relaxed completely.

After his bath, Lu Zhen returned to his room, leaving a slightly dazed Little Lily behind. While he had some thoughts about her, he knew that he needed to prioritize his strength in this dangerous world. Fun could come later, especially since he was still a virgin. But for now, his focus was on gaining more power.

As he entered his room, Lu Zhen first checked his status.

[LEVEL UP]

[Bloodline: Human/ Unawaken]

[Gluttony: level 1]

He felt satisfied seeing that he has levelled up his constitution and gained a new skill and even gained a year of lifespan.

As he was going to train again, a sudden realization struck him. If reaching his limit was the condition for improving his constitution, then there were other ways to achieve it beyond just doing push-ups. He could incorporate exercises like squats, lunges, pull-ups, and burpees to push his body to its limits.

As he thought to that point, he felt stupid as if the day of his hard work was just for show. Though he felt the urge to hit his head against a wall in frustration, he managed to control his impulses. After all, only his training will be hindered If he did that.

At that moment, a saying from his previous world came to mind: "Work smart, not hard." He now realized the true meaning of these words after he experienced it himself.

With the lesson he learned, Lu Zhen diligently carried on with his intense training regimen. He incorporated various exercises to challenge his body to its fullest potential.

Engrossed in his training, time seemed to slip away as he focused solely on honing his physical abilities. Each repetition, each movement was executed with precision and determination. He pushed himself beyond his comfort zone, striving to unlock the true potential of his body.

Lost in the rhythm of his training, Lu Zhen forgot about the passage of time. The world around him faded into the background as he immersed himself in the pursuit of physical excellence. Nothing else mattered in that moment except for the burning desire to push his body to its limits.

[You have reached your body limits.]

[Constitution has levelled up from level 6 to level 7.]

The system notification woke him up for his rhythm as the warm energy flooded his body tempering his body. Lu Zhen was still not satisfied with his progress and continued training like a mad man.

[You have reached your body limit.]

[Constitution has levelled up from level 7 to level 8.]

Again a warm sensation flooded in his body although his rhythm was broken it wasn't unpleasant as he started to feel the changes occurring in his body. It was as if he was going to his most perfect state in his body.

The strengthening he gained from level up has also increased. Which made Lu Zhen feel good but he still was not satisfied. So he continued his bitter training.

As he persisted in his grueling training, the level up took longer than usual to appear. Exhausted, Lu Zhen could barely rely on his trembling hands to continue.

Suddenly, a tremendous surge of energy engulfed Lu Zhen's body, coursing through his veins and permeating every cell. It felt as if his entire being was being forged and tempered in the fires of transformation. Waves of pleasure washed over him, surpassing any sensation he had ever experienced before. In that moment, he felt as if he had achieved a state of perfect harmony, where mind, body, and spirit aligned in perfect synchronization. It was a feeling of complete and utter fulfilment, as if he had unlocked the pinnacle of his potential. Lu Zhen felt invincible, as if he could conquer any challenge that lay before him.

[You have reached your body limit.]

[Constitution has levelled up from level 8 to level 9.]

As Lu Zhen saw the notification, his mind was too consumed by the overwhelming pleasure he had experienced. It took him a full hour to regain control of his senses. However, he soon noticed a repugnant smell emanating from his body, causing him to feel disgusted.

Realizing that the sticky and dirty smell came from his own body, Lu Zhen wasted no time and quickly left his room, heading straight to the bath. The moment he immersed himself in the refreshing cold water, a soothing sensation washed over him, relieving his senses. As he diligently cleansed himself, he could feel the grime and impurities being washed away, replaced by a renewed sense of cleanliness.

After the refreshing bath and a change of clothes, he finally felt comfortable and ready to test his newfound strength.

He found a dead wood piece about 20 inches thick wood in his room so he decided to test his strength on this. The wood in this world was many times harder than the wood that was in his previous life.

Taking a deep breath to focus his energy, he positioned himself in front of the wooden target. The muscles in his arm tensed, ready to unleash the force within him.

In one swift motion, he launched his fist forward, channeling all his strength into the punch. The impact echoed through the air as his fist collided with the wood, causing splinters to explode in all directions. The force of his blow was so immense that the wood shattered into countless pieces, scattering across the ground.

Curiosity piqued, Lu Zhen decided to test his jumping ability. With a light and effortless leap, he soared into the air, reaching a height of 8 feet. He could have gone higher, but the low ceiling imposed a limitation on his vertical reach.

Chapter 5: Verdant Blade

"Sigh, I have reached level 9 in constitution, but I think I have reached my limit. Looks like I need to cultivate Qi now to further promote my growth," Lu Zhen sighed in realization. He had initially believed that he could infinitely level up, but he soon faced the cold reality that he had reached the limitations of his mortal body.

After he reached level 9 in constitution, no matter how hard he trains his body seemed to have no improve whatsoever as if he has reached a bottleneck.

Now, the only way to continue enhancing his physical abilities was through the tempering of Qi as he could only think of qi to strengthen his body more from his memories.

And in order to sense and harness Qi, he needed a cultivation method.

"I guess I'll have to seek out my cheap father and mother for a cultivation method." Lu Zhen thought with a sigh.

Lost in his thoughts, he was interrupted by a sweet and gentle voice.

"Young master, the tea is ready." Little Lily said as she handed him a cup. The aroma of the tea wafted into Lu Zhen's nostrils, bringing a sense of calmness and clarity to his mind.

The tea that Lu Zhen was served was made from rare and precious leaves infused with Qi, making it highly valuable. These special leaves required meticulous care and were incredibly expensive. In fact, the cost of the tea leaves alone could sustain a normal family for an entire month.

The process of making this tea was not to be taken lightly. It demanded the expertise of skilled individuals who understood the intricacies of tea preparation. Patience and attention to detail were essential to bring out the full potential of the leaves. Any negligence in the process would result in wasted tea and the loss of its unique qualities.

As Lu Zhen's maid, Little Lily had been trained rigorously from a young age in the art of tea making. She had been taught the specific techniques needed to prepare the tea to perfection.

"Your tea-making skill has improved, Little Lily." Lu Zhen remarked, satisfied with the quality of the tea. He then pulled Little Lily closer, placing his arm around her waist, which caused her to yelp in surprise and feel embarrassed.

As Lu Zhen was flirting with his little maid, the door was suddenly swung open, revealing the presence of a beautiful woman. Despite her age, her beauty remained evident, and she exuded an aura of power that seemed capable of striking fear into mortal men. She had dark hair and captivating magenta eyes. Her facial features bore a resemblance to Lu Zhen, but with a more feminine touch.

Lu Zhen was taken aback by the unexpected presence of his mother. He quickly greeted her with respect, releasing Little Lily from his grasp and bowing his head.

"Greetings, Mother." Lu Zhen greeted her, trying to maintain a composed demeanor.

His mother, noticing his previous interaction with Little Lily, couldn't help but tease him.

"Son, it seems you have made quite the progress." Mother Lu remarked with a playful tone.

Unfazed by her comment, Lu Zhen invited his mother to have tea, praising Little Lily's improved tea-making skills.

"Mother, please join us for tea. Little Lily's tea-making skills have greatly improved," Lu Zhen said calmly, maintaining a poker face.

"Son, it is time for you to stop making excuses and start taking martial arts seriously. No more slacking off." Mother Lu said with a stern tone, dismissing Lu Zhen's attempts at conversation.

Lu Zhen wanted to say something in response, but Mother Lu paid no attention to him. Instead, she pulled out a book seemingly out of thin air and handed it to him.

She took out a thick book, almost new, with the smell of ink still in it, and handed it to him.

"This is the cultivation method of the Lu Family, The Verdant Blade. It is our family inheritance. Read it carefully," Mother Lu instructed, ignoring Lu Zhen as she walked away.

As she turned to leave, Mother Lu paused suddenly,

"Remember, my son, your destiny lies in your own hands." she said, her voice laced with hidden meaning. The words hung in the air, lingering in the air. With that final piece of advice, she resumed her departure, leaving Lu Zhen deep in thought.

Although Lu Zhen felt somewhat wronged as it was the previous host of his body who was the good for nothing. But he didn't take it to heart after all being indignant doesn't do you shit.

As Lu Zhen saw the book, a complex expression crossed his face. He had been contemplating ways to ask for the cultivation method while concealing his abnormal behavior, but he hadn't expected it to be in his hands so soon.

A deep sense of gratitude welled up within Lu Zhen towards his parents in this new life. In his previous life, his relentless pursuit of success had left little room for meaningful connection with them. He realized that he had neglected them, only offering occasional financial support. Determined to rectify his past mistakes, he made a solemn vow to himself. In this life, he would ensure his parents' protection and well-being.

With renewed vigor he went towards his room again to train.

As Lu Zhen delved into the pages of the book, his initial furrowed expression gradually relaxed.

The verdant art blade had four stages in total.

As long as Lu Zhen reaches the first stage the trainee level he could sense qi.

Although some talents in this world can sense qi naturally, most rely on a martial technique to sense qi.

Lu Zhen was not oblivious to that talent so he had only one option left to practice verdant blade art.

The verdant blade art is a saber weapon martial art which allows the practitioner to convert the attrivutless qi into wood qi allowing countless benefits for the practitioner.

Wood qi not only made the practitioner have more vitality compared to the martial artist in the same realm it also granted higher healing and more lifespan to the practitioner.

It was the core inheritance of the Lu family and Lu Zhen understood its true value. Although he was the young master of the family, he wasn't allowed to get the technique without making any contribution but his mother just casually handed it to him.

Which made Lu Zhen genuinely grateful to her.

Chapter 6: Saber mastery

Lu Zhen stood tall, his posture upright and resolute. In his hand, he gripped a gleaming saber, its polished blade reflecting the glint of determination in his eyes. With a swift and forceful motion, he swung the sabre, its path cutting through the air with a resounding whoosh.

At first glance, the pattern of his swings may have appeared random, but for those keen enough to observe, a hidden rhythm emerged. Each movement flowed seamlessly into the next, an intricate dance of steel and skill.

With every swing, Lu Zhen's body harmonized with the saber, creating a symphony of motion and precision. His muscles tensed and released in perfect synchrony, generating a controlled force that propelled the blade forward. The sound of the saber cleaving the air echoed like a battle cry.

[You have practiced with your saber.]

[You have acquired the saber mastery skill.]

As Lu Zhen practiced with the verdant blade art, a sudden notification prompted his excitement. Instantly, he felt information filling his mind, his body subtly attuning itself to the movements of the sabre.

When he swung his saber again, he instantly felt a heightened connection, as if the weapon had become an extension of his own hand. The force behind his swings became more powerful, brimming with newfound strength.

The saber mastery skill he just acquired brought about a profound change in Lu Zhen's abilities. Each swing of his saber flowed effortlessly, guided by a muscle memory as if he had practiced the sabre for decades. His grasp on the weapon grew stronger, and his strikes gained precision and impact.

"Hmm, not bad at all." Lu Zhen remarked with satisfaction. After just two days of practice, he had acquired his second skill, Saber Mastery. It lived up to its name, assisting him in mastering the art of the sabre and helping Lu Zhen to practice the verdant blade art faster.

It was as if a natural talent seemed to awaken within him as his body became more compatible with the saber. With each swing, he felt a deep sense of affinity and ease, as if the weapon and his body were in perfect harmony. It was as if he had been destined to wield the sabre with precision and grace.

Though, Lu Zhen still was not satisfied with his current level of strength. After all, his goal was to become a ruler, which won't be easy given the meager amount of strength he possesses.

In fact, Lu Zhen's speed can be considered monstrous. When he reached the peak of his constitution using his cheats he can be considered as a third tier martial artist without any Qi. This was an unprecedented achievement in this world. Unlike the majority of practitioners who focused primarily on qi cultivation.

In this world, where qi could automatically strengthen the practitioner's body, many overlooked the importance of physical training. Even those who did priorities physical constitution often found it to be a time-consuming and arduous process, with minimal gains to show for their efforts. Only Lu Zhen, with the aid of his cheat, had been able to push himself to the peak of his physical limits without relying on qi.

Due to his strong physique, Lu Zhen's progress in training the Verdant Blade Art was directly accelerated, unlike most individuals who would quickly tire. With his strong body, he could train in the art without requiring breaks or rest, granting him the advantage of uninterrupted practice. This dedication and advantage was also the reason he so quickly acquired the blade mastery skill.

"Looks like having a strong constitution is quite important, huh?" Lu Zhen mused to himself as he continued his training.

He felt like he was very close to reaching the first level of the verdant blade art.

In this world, the power system for martial artists was clearly defined. The trainee stage of martial arts training involved sensing qi into the body, marking the beginning of their journey. At this stage, the difference between an ordinary mortal and a martial arts trainee was minimal, with only a slight increase in attack power and a negligible increase in lifespan.

As martial artists progressed, they focused on developing pathways for qi to flow through their bodies, achieving a all-round strengthening. This marked the realm of third-tier martial artists, where their true journey began. A mortal would stand no chance against a third-tier martial artist unless the martial artist's qi was depleted. Their lifespan would experience a slight increase.

Further advancement involved increasing the purity of their qi, solidifying and condensing it until they could create a shield solely with their strengthened and purified qi. This was the realm of second-tier martial artists. The gap between a third-tier martial artist and a second-tier martial artist was substantial. Unless the shield of a second-tier martial artist was broken, they would remain invincible. Mortals would not even be able to touch a second-tier martial artist. Their lifespan would experience a significant increase.

Reaching the pinnacle of the martial technique, martial artists would give birth to a powerful intent that will integrate into their physical body. This marked their entry into the realm of first-tier martial artists, an almost immortal like state. First-tier martial artists experienced a nearly doubled lifespan, enabling them to achieve extraordinary feats. They gained the ability to fly, master the art of alchemy to concoct potent pills, and cast spells that defied the common sense of mortals.

With a single gaze, a martial artist could extinguish the life of an ordinary mortal, reducing them to ashes. Mortals were like mere ants to first-tier martial artists.

After the first tier, Lu Zhen didn't know what was higher and the verdant blade art only allowed him to reach first tier, the other realms were unknown to him for the time being.

In truth, every martial technique had the potential to lead a martial artist to the first tier, but their individual strength varied based on the complexity and attributes of the arts, as well as the abilities of the practitioners themselves.

The Verdant Blade Art, with its wood attribute, granted martial artists a significant amount of vitality, resulting in a longer lifespan and a stronger physical constitution. However, this did not mean that the wood attribute was inherently powerful. In fact, among the other basic attributes, it was considered the weakest in terms of strength.

However wood qi granted the best body growth and resilience compared to other elements which was undoubtedly suitable for Lu Zhen after all Lu Zhen have a strong physique. It undoubtedly suited him the most.

Chapter 7: Constitution Evolving

Qi is an ethereal energy that permeates the world, much like air. It is present everywhere, but it is invisible to the ordinary eye. Only martial artists possess the ability to sense qi, in fact the beginning of martial art was formed through the discovery of qi.

If Qi had not been discovered in this world, it might have followed a similar trajectory as Lu Zhen's previous world, the blue planet. In that world, collective strength and conformity were prioritised, while individual strength and uniqueness were often suppressed. People spent their days immersed in virtual conversations, disconnected from the natural world and caught up in trivial matters.

So qi was the base of all things in this world for martial artists.

Lu Zhen dedicated himself to practising the Verdant Saber Art relentlessly, as if there was no tomorrow. The sound of metal cutting through the air echoed throughout the training room.

[You have practised your sabre.]

[Your sabre mastery has levelled up from level 1 to level 2.]

[You have practised your sabre.]

[Your sabre mastery has levelled up from level 2 to level 3.]

After seven days of intense and grueling practice, Lu Zhen finally achieved the third level of blade mastery. In that moment, he felt a profound connection to the world, as if an ethereal energy permeated the air. Although he couldn't see it, he could sense its presence, as if he had unlocked a sixth sense. The world around him became much clearer, unveiling its hidden layers and secrets.

"Finally, I have reached the first level of the Verdant Blade Art." Lu Zhen thought with a mixture of excitement and satisfaction.

However, before he could celebrate, a sudden change occurred in his body.

Suddenly, all the surrounding qi that was surrounding Lu Zhen was inexplicably sucked into his body, drawn by a powerful force like a vacuum. His body, which had already reached its limit, began undergoing further strengthening.

[Your body has absorbed qi.]

[Your physical constitution is evolving...]

A sudden prompt appeared, leaving Lu Zhen confused. After all, this had never happened before in this world, at least from what Lu Zhen had heard.

"Hmm, what is happening? I have never heard of a person being able to directly absorb qi into their body." Lu Zhen thought to himself.

"Could it be that I have strengthened my body to the point where I can now directly absorb qi?" he contemplated. However, Lu Zhen quickly dismissed that conjecture, although his body was strong, it was not unparalleled. There were many martial artists with stronger bodies than him.

"Hmm, that leaves only two possible options: either my body, having reached its mortal limits, is now capable of absorbing qi directly, or it is due to my cheats."

Martial artists in this world faced a peculiar phenomenon where their bodies naturally rejected qi, making it impossible to directly absorb and utilise it. Instead, they had to rely on the creation of qi pathways to strengthen and store qi within their bodies.

However, Lu Zhen possessed the extraordinary ability to directly absorb qi into his body, bypassing the need for qi pathways. This unique advantage enabled him to skip the trainee stage of martial arts and directly enter the third stage martial realm. Although he still needed to gather more qi and his power was not yet sufficient, technically he had already reached the third stage of martial arts.

What set Lu Zhen apart even further was his increased efficiency and control over qi. With the ability to absorb qi directly, he could harness its power more effectively and store larger quantities of qi in his entire body. This allowed him to tap into a greater reservoir of energy, enhancing his martial abilities and providing him with a superior level of control compared to other martial artists who relied on their pathways.

Although the advantage was huge, Lu Zhen still felt a little uncomfortable as he was not in control and was being carried along by the flow. Nonetheless, he continued his training After all, that was the nature of life.

Life never unfolds exactly as one plans. No matter how meticulously one prepares, it always remains unpredictable. Lu Zhen had learned this from his previous life. He had never been academically exceptional, but his passion for exploring the virtual world led him to become a highly paid computer programmer, surpassing even his own expectations.

As Lu Zhen pondered, a sudden surge of familiar pleasure coursed through his being. Though he had grown accustomed to such sensations, this time it enveloped him with an intensity beyond any he had experienced before. The sheer magnitude of the pleasure seemed to transcend his physical being, reaching deep into the depths of his soul.

A profound sense of ecstasy washed over him, his face radiating with a blissful expression that reflected the overwhelming pleasure he felt within.

He experienced a level of pleasure surpassing anything he had ever felt before.

Overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the sensation, he directly fainted on the floor, unable to withstand the intensity of the pleasure.

As he fainted, suddenly his little brother rose up like a mighty dragon, standing tall and proud. As if reaching heaven, the sheer size of his monstrosity would have made females wet but too bad there weren't any females to watch his little brother or was there?

Time flowed steadily like a river, with each passing minute bringing about subtle changes in lu shen's body. A whole day had passed, yet Lu Zhen showed no signs of awakening from his slumber.

Little Lily, filled with concern, walked around in circles, her worried expression evident. "What should I do now that the young master hasn't come to eat for a day?" she pondered.

Over the past seven days, Lu Zhen had rarely gone outside, dedicating himself to intense training, emerging only to have meals twice a day and immerse himself in a cold water bath. The sound of metal cutting through the air resonated loudly from his training room, reaching the ears of Little Lily. She knew that her young master was training arduously, and she couldn't help but admire his unwavering determination.

In the past, Lu Zhen had been preoccupied with gambling and drinking, but now he devoted his entire day to training. This change brought joy to Little Lily's heart. However, on this particular day, Lu Zhen remained confined to his room, leaving Little Lily perplexed and worried that something might have occurred to her beloved young master.

Chapter 8: Divine physique

Little Lily, clad in her usual vibrant purple qipao, approached Lu Zhen's training room with a mixture of nervousness and hesitation. Standing in front of the door, she pondered whether she should enter or not, her heart filled with uncertainty.

"Should I go in? What if I disturb the young master?" Little Lily's mind was filled with worry, her thoughts swirling in a whirlwind of anxiety.

"But what if something has happened to the young master? He hasn't come out of his room to eat all day," she pondered, her worry growing with each passing moment.

As an orphan adopted into the Lu family, her loyalty to Lu Zhen ran deep. She had relied on him and trusted him since a young age, and her entire world revolved around him. The thought of disappointing him or incurring his displeasure was frightening to her.

However, after taking a moment to gather her thoughts and muster up her courage, she made the decision to enter Lu Zhen's training room.

As she stepped into the room, her eyes widened at the sight before her. Lu Zhen was lying peacefully on the cold floor, as if he had fainted.

His little brother is still standing tall like a giant dragon as if ready to pierce the heavens itself even after a day.

Little Lily couldn't help but feel a rush of embarrassment as her gaze met his little brother. The towering little brother made little Lily's mind go haywire as dirty thoughts swirled in her mind.

At that moment, a cracking sound resonated from Lu Zhen's body, causing the entire room to vibrate. Slowly, he awakened from his sleep, feeling a surge of energy and vitality coursing through his veins. Filled with newfound power, he casually threw a punch.

Swoosh! Swish!

The sound of air being torn reverberated in the room as his fist sliced through the air causing a slight ripple effect as if the very air was being torn apart.

"Oh, what are you doing here, Lily?" Lu Zhen finally noticed Little Lily, who appeared lost in a daze. Her face turned as red as a ripe tomato, as she looked very cute to Lu Zhen's eyes.

"Young master... That..." Little Lily stammered, her voice filled with fluster. She pointed with a trembling finger, unable to meet Lu Zhen's gaze due to her overwhelming shyness.

When Lu Zhen saw Little Lily pointing her finger downward, he followed her gaze and realized that his little brother was in full view, standing erect and proud.

"You should prepare food for me. I'll be right outside," Lu Zhen managed to say with a poker face, trying to divert the attention away from his current predicament.

"Yes, young master." Little Lily replied hurriedly, her face still flushed with embarrassment. She hastily left the room.

Ignoring his embarrassing situation, Lu Zhen checked his status.

"Not bad. Not only has my body become stronger, but my lifespan has also increased. The Qi section, which was previously uninitiated, has now reached the first level although technically I am a third stage martial artist. However, the Qi in my body is still weak and insufficient, to the point where I cannot even be considered a third stage martial artist."

"However, my constitution has evolved into a divine physique. Is this a unique power system of my cheat or something else?"

Lu Zhen pondered for a moment, contemplating the mysteries of the system. However, he quickly dismissed those thoughts, realizing that there was no point in getting lost in futile speculation. As long as he continued to grow stronger, everything else would fall into place in due time.

With a decisive mindset, Lu Zhen left his room and made his way to the dining area and ate his dinner.

While Little Lily continued to blush and her cheeks remained flushed, she tried her best to compose herself in the presence of Lu Zhen. The embarrassment from their earlier encounter lingered, causing her heart to flutter whenever she caught a glimpse of him.

She kept her gaze lowered, avoiding direct eye contact with Lu Zhen. Her inner emotion was filled with a mixture of shyness and nervousness, making it difficult for her to find the right words to say.

Lu Zhen, oblivious to his little maids inner emotions kept eating his meal even if he knew he wouldn't care much.

As Lu Zhen consumed his meal, he couldn't help but notice that despite levelling up his Gluttony skill, the nourishing effects of the food felt insufficient. It seemed as though the energy provided by the food was like a mere drop in the vast ocean of his strength, barely causing a ripple. No matter how hard he tried to absorb every bit of energy, it felt meagre and unsatisfying.

"Seems like these meagre resources won't be enough for my progress. I need access to better resources if I want to accelerate my growth," Lu Zhen thought to himself.

"Let's go, little lily." Lu Zhen commanded Little Lily who still had a red face like a tomato.

With a decisive mindset, he left his residence, which resembled a grand palace in its own right, and made his way towards his mother's chambers. The Lu Mansion was a colossal structure, with each family descendant having their own mansion within the estate.

When the servants caught sight of Lu Zhen, their eyes widened in astonishment. The air around him seemed to crackle with an overwhelming aura, radiating a majestic and commanding presence.

The black robe, which was once loosely draped around Lu Zhen's frame, now clung tightly to his chiseled physique. The fabric strained against his well-defined muscles, accentuating every curve and bulge.

When the servants saw Lu Zhen, they were stunned by the imposing aura he emanated. But not forgetting their place, the servants quickly composed themselves and bowed respectfully.

"We greet the young master," they said in unison.

Lu Zhen gave a casual nod as he walked towards the wife's palace in the Lu family estate.

"Did you feel the young master's aura? It's incredibly powerful now," murmured one of the maids in awe.

"Yeah, I didn't even dare to breathe in his presence. That domineering aura is truly something," added another servant, her voice filled with reverence.

The servants murmured amongst themselves for a brief moment, but they soon returned to their duties.

Lu Zhen didn't find his mother in the wife's palace so he became confused where she could have gone.

Lu Zhen casually asked a guard, "Where is my mother?"

The guard felt a little nervous but still replied, "Young master, madam should be in the patriarch hall right now."

Lu Zhen nodded as he walked towards the most grand palace in the Lu family estate.

Chapter 9: I have fiance now??

As Lu Zhen made his way to the palace, he couldn't help but overhear some murmurs among the servants.

"Looks like the young master's fianc√©e has arrived..."

"Madam and master are welcoming them personally..."

"I heard she is from the Jiang family... but they are just a second-rate family..."

A frown appeared on Lu Zhen's face as he heard the distant voices of the servants' gossip. Ever since he reached the divine physique level in his constitution, all his senses had been enhanced to a superhuman level. He could now hear and perceive things that were previously beyond his grasp.

After all the constitution is all rounded stats of Lu Zhen's body he is probably past being the strongest man in his previous world by now.

Not only did it grant lu zhen insane body strength it also enhanced lu zhens five senses.

The guards of the palace were stunned when they saw Lu Zhen, but they maintained their composure.

"We greet the young master," the guards said respectfully as they opened the door of the palace.

As Lu Zhen stepped inside, he was greeted by a simple yet spacious room with a brown marble-like object on the floor. The room had minimal furnishing, with only a few chairs placed around.

In those chairs, two men were seated. One had a muscular build and emitted a terrifying aura, but his aged face lacked vigor, bearing some resemblance to Lu Zhen. The other man had a leaner build and a weaker aura, but he appeared somewhat younger, displaying a hint of vitality despite his aged appearance.

Seated beside the muscular man was Lu Zhen's mother, indicating that he was his cheap father in this world.

On the other side, next to the lean man, sat a girl with an ethereal beauty. She exuded an aura of coldness, like an immortal princess untouched by the dirt of this world. Her skin was fair, with beautiful facial features, and she possessed dark, shiny, long hair. Similar to lu zhen's black hair. She had an indifferent expression on her face.

"Greetings, mother and father," Lu Zhen said, bowing slightly in respect.

The lean man, Jiang Lao, was taken aback when he sensed Lu Zhen's powerful aura. He couldn't help but express his surprise, "Brother lu, judging by Lu Zhen's aura, he must have definitely practised martial arts and his achievements shouldn't be small. It seems we should never believe in rumours, as they are often baseless. You have truly opened my eyes today."

Even Lu Huang and Mother Lu aka lu ying were astonished by Lu Zhen's newfound strength, but they accepted the compliment happily. "Thank you, Brother Jiang," Lu Huang replied, with a smile on his face.

Although they were unaware of the changes Lu Zhen had undergone, they were delighted to see their son's progress. After all, what parents wouldn't wish the best for their child?

The woman with the cold aura aka Jiang Xue was also surprised for an instance before assuming her indifferent expression again.

"Father, what is happening here?" Lu Zhen asked, his tone filled with curiosity. After spending a few days in this world, Lu Zhen had fully adapted to his new identity and could imitate the behaviours of the previous host effortlessly.

After all, sudden strength can be explained but different behaviour would be suspicious. As it normally takes years to change anyone's habit. If habits can be changed quickly they can't be called habits.

Lu Zhen's question hung in the air as he awaited his father's response. His eyes shifted from his father to the woman with the cold aura, as if trying to gauge the situation.

He had an idea of what was happening from the murmurs he heard from the servants outside but he still kept an ignorant expression. After all, sometimes being ignorant is advantageous.

His father, Lu Huang, let out a hearty laugh, seemingly impressed by Lu Zhen's directness. "Well, my boy, it seems that you've undergone quite a transformation. Judging from your aura, you must have at least entered the martial trainee realm already. I must admit, I underestimated you."

"We have arranged this marriage, and if nothing goes wrong and you both are okay with it, you will be married together, strengthening our family bonds," Lu Huang said without keeping any suspense.

"Father, I..." Lu Zhen began to speak, but his mother, Lu, interjected.

"Son, we know you are not interested in marriage right now, but you should give it a try," she said, addressing Lu Zhen's apparent disinterest in romantic relationships. The previous host, known for his indulgent lifestyle, had shown little interest in women. Even until now, Lu Zhen was still a virgin, a fact that highlighted his lack of interest in the opposite sex.

Lu Zhen couldn't help but wonder about the previous host's sexual preferences. However, he knew from his memories that an accident during his childhood had left the previous host with little interest in women. This explained his current disposition.

"You should both spend time together; it will strengthen your bond, my son-in-law," Jiang Lao said, causing a frown to appear on Jiang Xue's face.

Lu Zhen didn't expect the old man to be so shameless, practically giving his daughter away on a silver platter. Nevertheless, he found himself slightly intrigued by this cold woman. Her beauty surpassed even that of Little Lily, with well-defined curves in all the right places and a slim, graceful physique. It suited Lu Zhen's taste.

However, it was clear that Jiang Xue wasn't happy with the arrangement, and Lu Zhen didn't blame her. His infamous reputation in the city made it a natural reaction for anyone to be hesitant about marrying him. Or it might be some other reason. Still, he was not one to be discouraged easily.

Lu Zhen believed that feelings could be cultivated over time, and he had never tried courting a girl in his previous life. So he wanted to experience courting in this life. Despite being power-hungry, he still wanted to fulfil the regrets he had in his past life.

With a little hesitation, Lu Zhen responded, "Of course, father-in-law."

Chapter 10: Jiang xue

"I wonder what Miss Jiang would like," Lu Zhen said with a calm tone as they walked in the backyard of the palace.

"Young Master Lu, I don't like you. I hope you will withdraw from this marriage," Jiang Xue said bluntly, her expression still indifferent.

Lu Zhen was stunned by her directness. He didn't expect Jiang Xue to be so straightforward. Still, since the marriage proposal came from the weak Jiang family, there must have been some problem they couldn't handle, or they just wanted to rely on the Lu family. Either way, they needed something, so they came to the Lu family for the marriage proposal.

"Alright, Miss Jiang. As a matter of fact, I also don't like this marriage, so I will notify Jiang Lao about your withdrawal from the marriage," Lu Zhen said with an honest tone, as if he really wanted to withdraw from the marriage.

Jiang Xue was stunned, and for the first time, a worried expression appeared on her cold face, making her even more beautiful.

"No, wait, Young Master Lu, I hope you will say that you want to withdraw, not me," Jiang Xue said with a worried expression.

Lu Zhen didn't expect the girl to be so shameless. She wanted to withdraw from the marriage, but she wanted him to withdraw first, as if to save face or avoid taking responsibility for her decision. It was clear that she was trying to manipulate the situation in her favor.

Still, Lu Zhen respectfully said, "Miss Jiang, your family was the one to propose the marriage, and now‚Ä¶"

"Yes, I am being shameless, Young Master, but I hope you understand my situation. I really don't want to get married. I have ambitions and goals which have not been fulfilled."

"Alright, Miss Jiang, since you are so adamant about it, let's say we don't like each other."

Lu Zhen secretly sneered in his heart. This Jiang family was really something. He didn't expect the father to already consider him a son-in-law, but the daughter was adamant about breaking the marriage. Either way, Lu Zhen didn't care; after all, he was determined to pursue this woman, by hook or crook. so he cooked up a plan in his head.

"However, Miss Jiang, it might be a little inappropriate if we simply say that we don't like each other without any evidence. How about we go to a restaurant and spend some time together? After a while, we can convincingly tell them that we truly don't like each other," Lu Zhen suggested, with a poker face.

Jiang Xue was a little hesitant, but after contemplating for a while, she agreed.

"Prepare the carriage, Yu Bai."

"Yes, young master."

Yu Bai responded respectfully as he prepared the carriage.

Lu Zhen sat in the carriage and, like a gentleman, gently helped Jiang Xue to sit beside him by guiding her into the carriage with his hand. Her tender hands, with silk-like smooth skin, made him reluctant to let go, but he eventually released her hand.

As she got closer to Lu Zhen, the alluring aroma of orchids wafted into his nose, captivating him with its fragrance. He couldn't help but be drawn to the enchanting scent.

He also guided his little maid, Lily, to sit opposite them.

"Start the carriage, Old Yu, and bring us to the Golden Restaurant," Lu Zhen instructed.

The Golden Restaurant was the best establishment in the city, and it was one of the properties owned by the Lu family. As one of the four major families in Phoenix City, the Lu family had business interests in various sectors, but their most renowned business was in the restaurant industry.

As the carriage moved slowly, Lu Zhen, Jiang Xue, and Little Lily sat quietly. The atmosphere was somewhat tense and awkward, as none of them were enthusiastic about the arranged meeting.

Lu Zhen observed Jiang Xue for a moment before deciding to break the ice. "Miss Jiang, I wonder what dishes you like."

"I like dumplings," Jiang Xue replied simply.

"Oh, I also like dumplings, Miss Jiang. It looks like we have a lot in common," Lu Zhen said, attempting to start a casual conversation and ease the tension.

Although Jiang Xue was initially hesitant, she eventually warmed up to the conversation, and the atmosphere became less uncomfortable. Lu Zhen led the conversation in a friendly way with his sense of humor.

Soon Lu Zhen's effort bore fruit as Jiang Xue started opening up to Lu Zhen. They started conversing happily while laughing.

Little Lily's eyes narrowed slightly as she observed Lu Zhen and Jiang Xue engaged in conversation. A pout formed on her adorable face, and her cheeks seemed to puff up like a balloon, making her look even cuter. Her usual lively demeanor was momentarily overshadowed by a tinge of insecurity and a feeling of being left out.

As Lu Zhen's personal servant since childhood, Little Lily knew her place, but she couldn't help feeling a deep connection to him. She had become wholly dependent on Lu Zhen, and he was her everything.

In the past, Lu Zhen had always been distant from other females, except for her and his mother. However, now she noticed a change in him as he began to flirt and interact with other women. It brought her happiness to see him opening up, but at the same time, a twinge of jealousy nagged at her heart.

As countless emotions swirled deep down in Little Lily, she tried her best to hide her feelings and maintain a calm facade.

Meanwhile, in a remote corner of the street, six men dressed in black ninja attire anxiously awaited their next move. The leader of the group wore an elephant mask, while his subordinates donned monkey masks on their faces.

"We have been given orders to assassinate the young miss of the Jiang family," the leader said in a grim tone as he closed the black scroll. Suddenly, the black scroll lit up with fire, and in an instant, it disappeared without leaving any trace behind.

"But what about the young master of the Lu family?" asked another figure with the same dress but wearing a monkey mask. His voice was filled with respect, clearly indicating that he was a subordinate.

"Monkey number 3, don't kill the young master," the leader replied after a brief pause. "If he gets in the way, you can kill him."

Upon hearing this, a glint of murderous intent flashed in the eyes of the person with the monkey mask. He was one of five individuals in the group wearing monkey masks and black ninja-like attire, and all of them exuded a chilling aura.

Chapter 11: Assassin attack (1)

"Miss Jiang‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen's voice trailed off as he suddenly felt that something was amiss. The street, which was previously bustling, went completely silent. Although this street was relatively secular from the memories of the previous host, it wasn't supposed to be this eerily silent to this extent.

Before he could make sense of the situation, his heart pounded in terror as a deadly arrow shot forth with lightning speed. The arrow seemed to materialize from the shadows, heading straight for the carriage. Its black color allowed it to blend seamlessly with the surroundings, making it nearly impossible to detect until it was too late.

Lu Zhen's mind raced, but he couldn't react in time. The arrow whizzed past him with deadly accuracy, heading directly for Jiang Xue's head.

Panic and fear gripped Lu Zhen's heart as he anticipated the worst. However, the horrifying scene of the arrow piercing Jiang Xue's head and coming out the other side, with her brain matter stuck to the arrow and blood splattered, didn't unfold.

Instead, to his astonishment, a barrier seemingly materialized out of thin air, protecting Jiang Xue. The arrow collided with the barrier, creating a resonating clang that echoed through the carriage. The arrow created a ripple in the barrier before losing its momentum, but the barrier held strong, stopping the arrow in its tracks, leaving Jiang Xue unharmed.

Lu Zhen didn't think too much about it as there were more pressing matters at hand right now. After all, the assassins wouldn't give up easily. Attacking the only young master of the Lu family in the city was akin to signing their own death warrant. The attackers must have been prepared for the consequences.

As expected, this was just the beginning. Arrows rained down on them with lightning-fast speed, filling the air with deadly projectiles.

However, the arrows were useless now; they were only effective when catching someone off guard. Any normal martial trainee could easily dodge and deflect the arrows if they were prepared.

"How dare you try to attack the young master? Are you courting death?" Yu Bai said with anger. He casually waved his hand, and all the arrows, as if on command, halted their momentum and fell to the ground.

Yu Bai couldn't respond in time previously because he, too, was caught off guard. The arrow was incredibly fast, and he feared that any harm to the young master would lead to the madam's unforgiving wrath, not to mention the guilt he would feel himself. Fortunately, the arrow was aimed at Jiang Xue, sparing Lu Zhen from harm. As for jiang xue it was none of his business.

Lu Zhen couldn't help but be surprised by Yu Bai's technique. After all, technically, he was also a third-stage martial artist, but he couldn't pull off this feat due to his meager Qi, even though he was technically at the same stage.

It wasn't only because of this that Lu Zhen was surprised; it was also because Yu Bai could almost materialize Qi outside his body, a clear sign of a peak third-stage martial artist.

He didn't expect Yu Bai to be a peak third-stage martial artist. After all, from the memories he got, Yu Bai was a frail old man and barely a third-stage martial artist.

"Oh, I didn't expect a peak third-stage martial artist to be a mere coachman," a deep, cold tone resounded throughout the place, showing no emotion in its tone.

Although the voice was clearly heard, it seemed to come from all directions as if it were spoken by four different people with the same voice.

"Hmph, petty tricks," Yu Bai snorted, punching to his left side.

Suddenly, a person wearing a black ninja dress with an elephant mask appeared right where Yu Bai had punched. The man barely managed to block Yu Bai's punch, taking a step back to regain his balance.

"Dammit, this old man is strong," the assassin thought to himself as he stepped back to a safe distance before swiftly drawing the black sword tied to his waist.

The slight delay that it took to draw his sword was enough time to let Yu Bai close in on him as Yu Bai delivered a second punch with full power.

"Elephant punch."

The assassin felt a terrifying fist descend upon him. Luckily for him, his survival instinct kicked in as he used a sword technique to attack. After all, the best defense was offense.

"Silent Death sword strike," the assassin muttered in his mind.

The sword emanated a black aura, rendering it almost invisible to the naked eye as the masked man counterattacked the old man.

As the masked man's sword clashed with the old man's fist, a unique and unsettling combination of sounds filled the air. A sharp "clank" echoed as the cold, unforgiving metal of the sword collided with the old man's hardened fist. Accompanying it was a dull "thud," signifying the extraordinary force behind the old man's strike.

Clank! Thud!!

Yu Bai took a step back, while the masked man retreated two steps.

"Looks like this won't be an easy fight. I should let my subordinate carry out the assassination of the young miss from the Jiang family," the masked man thought, refusing to back down as he continued to fight the old man with all his might.

The old man also fought with full power, taking the masked man's attack seriously.

Meanwhile, five men dressed in black ninja attire, each wearing identical monkey masks, surrounded Lu Zhen, Jiang Xue, and Little Lily.

"Young master Lu, please step aside. We are here to assassinate Miss Jiang, and you shouldn't get involved," one of the men said in a seemingly respectful manner, but his tone carried a hint of rudeness and mockery.

"Oh, then assassinate the Jiang family miss. It doesn't concern us. Let's go, Little Lily," Lu Zhen calmly instructed, stunning both the assassin and Jiang Xue.

"Miss Jiang, our interactions may have been friendly during this chat, but in reality, we are still strangers. I respect the choice you've made to annual our marriage, and I believe it's best if we part ways now. Goodbye," Lu Zhen said respectfully as he prepared to leave with Little Lily.

The five masked men glanced at each other, then one of them wearing a monkey mask spoke up, "What about the old man then?" He pointed in the direction the intense battle between their leader and Yu Bai.

"I will allow him to withdraw from the battle," Lu Zhen replied in an emotionless tone.

As he left with Little Lily, she hesitated for a moment but ultimately followed Lu Zhen's orders. His commands were absolute for her, and she trusted his judgement completely.

Chapter 12: Assassin attack (2)

"Hahahaha, that coward really left the battle. Looks like the reputation of the young master of the Lu family as an incompetent was true," one of the men in the monkey mask said, laughing as they watched Lu Zhen and Little Lily leaving in the distance.

"Be careful, Number 3. Although that brat has left, this young miss of the Jiang family is not easy to deal with," another masked man warned.

Although they were initially stunned by Lu Zhen's departure, they couldn't help but feel relieved. Despite their bloodthirsty nature, they were not stupid. They knew that if anything had happened to Lu Zhen, the Lu family would pursue them relentlessly until they were eradicated.

Moreover, their own backer had a similar background to the Lu family, which meant they couldn't rely on them for support. If the situation turned sour, they would likely be used as sacrificial lambs to bear the brunt of the Lu family's anger. Thus, they were cautious about their actions, especially when it came to dealing with the formidable Lu family.

As for the matter of Lu Zhen tricking them or calling for backup, they didn't consider these possibilities. After all, they believed that Lu Zhen hadn't practised martial arts; he was recognized as trash throughout the city for a reason, despite the huge influence of the Lu family.

As for any potential backup, they dismissed the idea, confident that they could deal with Jiang Xue swiftly before any reinforcements could arrive. The element of surprise and their swift assassination skills were their best allies. Little did they know that underestimating Lu Zhen was their demise.

Meanwhile, Jiang Xue knew that she had refused the marriage, and it would be shameless of her to hope Lu Zhen would risk his life to save her. So, logically, she understood his decision. However, deep inside, she couldn't help feeling a tinge of disappointment.

Ignoring her inner feelings, she focused on how to defend against the five attackers until backup arrived as she swiftly took out her whip.

After all, despite being a martial genius who reached the martial trainee realm at the age of 18, she was up against five assassins who were also in the martial trainee realm. It would be a challenging battle, but it was still not hopeless.

"Silent death strike," a masked man muttered in his head as he sneakily attacked Jiang Xue from behind.

The strike was executed with utter silence, requiring minimal movement, and the sword was barely visible to the untrained eye.

However, Jiang Xue's instincts kicked in, and she instantly felt the chilling presence behind her. Without a second thought, she swung the whip in her hand, using it to strike her behind her in a powerful sweep without looking.

"Ice whip."

In a swift transformation, the whip turned icy cold, but the strange thing was that it remained elastic despite its coldness.

The cold whip met the almost invisible blade. A loud crack rang out as the whip clashed with the blade, and although the whip had a slight crack on it, the sword was successfully pushed back by Jiang Xue's skillful defense.

At the same moment, four knives were thrown at Jiang Xue from four different directions, catching her off guard.

The knives were on the verge of piercing Jiang Xue, but just in the nick of time, the barrier appeared again, firmly blocking the knives' momentum and protecting her from harm.

The assassins grew increasingly annoyed by the appearance of the barrier, realizing that their first attempt would have succeeded if not for this unexpected hindrance.

Jiang Xue's heart raced as she bit her lip, feeling the weight of the situation. In a desperate attempt to maintain her composure, she tightly gripped a bracelet in her hand hidden under her sleeve. Upon closer inspection, one could notice a slight crack on it, barely noticeable, but it seemed to hold a hidden significance for her.

"Humph, I don't believe this barrier will last forever. Let's all attack together," one of the assassins declared, his frustration evident in his voice.

In a synchronized assault, the five assassins launched their attacks simultaneously, leaving Jiang Xue with little room to dodge. The barrier appeared once again, hindering their attempts, but the assassins remained undeterred. They attacked relentlessly, throwing knives, bombs, and poisons at the barrier, determined to break through and reach their target.

As the barrage of attacks continued, the barrier made ripples but stood firm, withstanding all the assaults thrown at it by the assassins.

However, Jiang Xue's anxiety grew with each passing moment as she felt the bracelet hidden under her sleeve cracking more and more. The once barely noticeable crack had widened, causing her heart to race with worry.

At that very moment, the assassin positioned at the far end of the ambush felt an eerie chill crawling up his spine, causing the hair on the back of his neck to stand on end. Reacting swiftly, he turned around, his senses heightened to detect any lurking danger. With a precise motion, he swung his sword in a defensive arc.

As the assassin turned around, a simple saber swing greeted his eyes, and he swiftly brought his sword to meet the attack. Initially, relief washed over him as he believed he had successfully defended against the strike.

Yet, when their weapons collided, an overwhelming force descended upon him, filling him with horror. Despite pushing with all his might, the sabre remained steady and unmoving, as if he were a mere bug. He couldn't even budge the saber in the slightest direction.

In the face of this terrifying strength, the assassin's mind raced with countless possibilities, but he was granted no time for further contemplation.

In the blink of an eye, the saber slashed through his sword as if it were mere paper, leaving the assassin utterly defenseless.

With horror-struck eyes, the assassin witnessed the unstoppable momentum of the saber. The blade swiftly and cleanly sliced through his head from the upper part, leaving no chance for escape. The deadly path of the saber continued, mercilessly cutting through the assassin's body, cleaving him into two halves with chilling precision.

The blood of the assassin splashed onto the man holding the saber, revealing Lu Zhen with an emotionless face.

Although the fight might have looked long, it happened in a split second, leaving the other assassins to not be able to react in time.

They could only watch helplessly as their comrade died right in front of them split in half.

Chapter 13: Assassin attack (3)

There was an eerie silence for a moment.

All four assassins had horror in their eyes, not because their comrade was split in two halves, but because of the terrifying strength Lu Zhen displayed. His power was comparable to that of a third-stage martial practitioner, which filled them with dread.

As assassins, they were accustomed to witnessing their comrades die like grass, but the overwhelming strength Lu Zhen demonstrated left them shaken to the core, spiraling into despair. They knew they stood no chance against a third-stage martial artist. So the only thing they could do now was escape as far as possible from this monster.

"Where do you think you are going?"

Without delay, they all sprinted away in four different directions, desperately trying to escape.

However, Lu Zhen was faster than them. Before they could make any significant distance, one of the assassins was already dead, his head cleanly severed by Lu Zhen's swift and deadly sabre. Lu Zhen's face remained emotionless, as if life was as insignificant as grass to him.

The three remaining assassins were even more terrified now, running with all their might. But no matter how fast they ran, Lu Zhen was always ahead, reaching each one in an instant and swiftly dispatching them with a single swing of his sabre. Within moments, all four assassins lay dead, like insects crushed underfoot.

He only used his raw strength with no tricks, simply slashing with his sabre without any fancy techniques. After all, Lu Zhen's body strength was at least that of a third-stage martial artist, even before his constitution broke through its mortal limits. Now, he didn't even know what his raw strength level was. Lu Zhen directly overwhelmed the assassins, who were only martial trainees, with just his raw power alone.

"Miss Jiang, are you alright?" Lu Zhen asked in his emotionless tone as he turned to face Jiang Xue, his whole body soaked in blood. His expression was devoid of any emotion, giving him the appearance of an asura. He crossed his arms behind him, making him look like an expert.

Although in reality, Lu Zhen's mind was in chaos, and his hands were shaking from the bloodshed he had just committed by himself.

Jiang Xue was frightened a little when she saw Lu Zhen's body covered in blood, but she regained her composure soon after.

"Thank you, young master, for your help," Jiang Xue said in an extremely grateful tone, but her face which was cold and indifferent expression carried a doubtful expression now.

Jiang Xue's mind was in turmoil as she tried to make sense of what she had just witnessed. The once infamous trash young master of Phoenix City, who had been considered weak and worthless, was now revealed to possess unimaginable power. At just 18 years old, he had already reached the third stage of martial arts, a level of talent that was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.

As a martial prodigy herself, achieving the martial trainee realm at the age of 18, Jiang Xue couldn't help but feel a pang of envy and insecurity. She had always taken pride in her abilities, but now, seeing Lu Zhen, she couldn't help but feel inadequate in comparison.

For a brief moment, she even entertained the thought that Lu Zhen had been taken over by someone else. Could he have been possessed or controlled by another being? However, Jiang Xue quickly dismissed such childish thoughts, reminding herself that it was just her imagination running wild.

Little did Jiang Xue know that she had hit the nail right on the head. As she was lost in her own thoughts, she was interrupted by a cold voice.

"Miss Jiang, can you turn around?" Lu Zhen said with his cold tone. Although Jiang Xue was confused, she still turned around, facing away from Lu Zhen, feeling a little scared.

Lu zhen wanted to gather his thoughts so he had asked jiang to turn around.

Lu Zhen's body trembled as he tried to control the urge to vomit.

"Oh my god, did I really kill 5 men in cold blood‚Ä¶?" Lu Zhen thought to himself, trying to calm down. After all, he was from the blue planet and came from an average background, so he hadn't even seen killing before. Although he didn't want to admit it, he was influenced by society, making him not accept killing so easily.

Suddenly, a notification prompted him to be happy, even though he was barely controlling himself to throw up.

[You have adapted to killing.]

[You have acquired a new skill: adaptability.]

Suddenly, the urge to vomit went away, and Lu Zhen felt calm again. As he felt calm he looked at his body drenched with blood so he decided to change his clothes.

He put on a fresh set of clothes taken from the carriage, making sure to clean off as much blood as possible.

As Jiang Xue stood there, she heard some rustling sounds from behind her. As the saying goes "curiosity kills the cat", curiosity got the better of her, and she couldn't resist taking a quick peek. What she saw left her stunned.

Jiang Xue's face flushed red as she saw Lu Zhen naked, about to put on his clothes. His body was on full display, revealing well-defined six-pack abs and tightly-packed muscles without an ounce of fat. Although he was on the lean side, his muscles emitted a unique aura that made Jiang Xue feel like he was entirely composed of pure muscle.

Jiang Xue's embarrassment intensified when she noticed that, in addition to Lu Zhen's impressive physique, his "little brother" was also fully exposed. Despite its head being down, it was still considerably large, even in its slumbering state. The sight was enough to make her cheeks turn an even deeper shade of red, and she quickly averted her gaze.

The situation became even more awkward for Jiang Xue as she struggled to keep her composure. She tried her best to forget what she had seen and focused on the fact that Lu Zhen had just saved her life. But the image of his muscular body and his "little brother" remained etched in her mind, leaving her feeling both flustered and embarrassed.

Lu Zhen noticed Jiang Xue's little peek, but he didn't mind it much. He was proud of his body in this world, which he had achieved through his own "effort". In his previous life, he was jealous of bodybuilders who flaunted their physiques, but now he had a body that surpassed mortal limits. He was undoubtedly proud and didn't mind showing it to Jiang Xue.

After cleaning off the blood and changing his clothes, Lu Zhen started talking to the meek Jiang Xue, who still had her head down the previous indifferent expression was no more.

"Miss Jiang, I hope you won't be mad about my previous actions. I had to take care of Little Lily's safety as well. Even though they were weak to me, they might somehow have harmed her. After all, she is just a mortal," Lu Zhen said, still maintaining his emotionless expression.

He continued, ignoring the too-shy Jiang Xue, who had momentarily forgotten about the life-or-death battle she had just faced. In any case, having a near death experience is quite unpleasant.

"And I also hope that you will keep my power a secret between ourselves." Lu Zhen waited for an answer from Jiang Xue.

"Young master lu might have some secrets but I also have secrets," she thought as she gripped her bracelet and spoke.

"Of course, young master, I will keep this a secret," Jiang Xue replied in a determined tone. In her mind, she felt a sense of gratitude for Lu Zhen. Despite her rejection of the marriage proposal, he had saved her life, and she felt indebted to him.

Lu Zhen nodded satisfied with Jiang Xue although he didn't know what was going on in the mind of these women but from the tone of it. It looks like his strength won't be revealed anytime soon. So Lu Zhen was satisfied.

Chapter 14: Adaptability

Just as Lu Zhen and Jiang Xue finished their conversation, a loud sound was heard from where the battle between Yu Bai and the assassin leader had taken place. They both hurriedly rushed towards the site of the fight.

The location of the battle was quite far from where Lu Zhen had fought the assassins. As they ran towards the source of the sound, Lu Zhen noticed broken debris, with houses almost half destroyed and everything in disarray.

A sense of unease washed over Lu Zhen. This secluded street was usually ignored and rarely visited, but even so, with so much commotion, there should have been at least a few people around. The complete absence of any witnesses made Lu Zhen feel like something was wrong.

Not only did lu zhen feel that something was wrong Jiang Xue also felt that something was wrong however they still continued to walk.

Just as they reached the scene, they heard a cold voice.

"Old man, why are you blocking our way? We are not even here for your young master," the assassin leader said in misery. The remnants of his assassin mask hung loosely, revealing a face marred with swelling and bruises. Blood trickled from a cut on his forehead, mixing with the dirt on his face.

His body, too, bore the scars of a fierce battle. Dark marks covered his exposed skin, indicating the impact of powerful strikes. His clothes were torn and stained with blood, a testament to the ferocity of the attack he had endured.

"Hmph, how dare you try to court death by attacking the young master of the Lu family? If you wanted to assassinate the young miss of the Jiang family, you could have done it at any other time. Besides, the young Miss Jiang is going to be engaged to the young master soon, so how dare you even try to assassinate her?"

When the assassin heard this, he felt somewhat wronged.

"Bastard, I would have tried it already, but she never leaves the Jiang state, and even when she does, she is always accompanied by her father. Wouldn't I be counting death in front of the patriarch of the Jiang family if I attempted to assassinate his daughter in front of him? After all, he is a half-stage second-stage martial artist. When we finally got the chance, I met this monster," the assassin leader thought, clearly aware that he was no match for the old man from their earlier fight.

Realising that escape was the best option, the assassin quickly turned and ran, leaving the old man stunned.

As he ran, the assassin taunted, "Hmph, your effort is futile, old man. My subordinate should have already finished them." He let out a sinister laugh as he blended into the shadows, disappearing from sight.

Although the old man wanted to chase after the assassin, he didn't. Even though he was stronger than him, killing him won't be easy; after all, they were both at the peak of the third stage martial realm. It was not easy to kill people of the same realm. Moreover, he was more worried about the young master, so he swiftly went to find him.

However, to his astonishment, he heard the familiar voice.

"Old Bai, we should leave. I am not in the mood for eating now," Lu Zhen signaled towards Jiang Xue and made a gesture.

"Young master, I wonder what happened to the assassins who were after you?" Old Bai asked, with a doubtful expression on his face.

After all, Lu Zhen has just started practising martial arts and has just entered the martial trainee realm, and Jiang Xue is also in the martial trainee stage. There was no possibility of them defeating five martial trainees all at once. Although the mob technique doesn't work when you reach the higher stage of martial arts, in the early state (martial trainee), no matter how powerful you are, a hundred ordinary people can shred you to pieces. So old bai was doubtful about how could they come here safe and sound.

"Oh, a mysterious person came to our rescue and killed all the assassins in a single slash," Lu Zhen winked at Jiang Xue. Although Jiang Xue knew that the mysterious person was Lu Zhen himself, since she promised to protect Lu Zhen's secret, she nodded.

"That mysterious person was terrifyingly powerful; he effortlessly killed all the assassins. He should be a third-stage martial artist," Jiang Xue chimed in.

Old Bai nodded in agreement, still somewhat sceptical, but he trusted his young master's judgement. "I'm glad you both are safe. Let's return to the estate and inform the family about what happened."

With that said, they all quickly departed to where the carriage was. Little Lily had been hiding when Lu Zhen and she left. Lu Zhen placed Little Lily in the carriage and then went to help Jiang Xue. After all, Lu Zhen was a stubborn man; how could he watch a woman whom he found interesting die? Though that was a small part of the reason, the real motive was to test his own strength. Lu Zhen's drive for strength was greater than anything.

The results were quite satisfactory as well. Not only did he test his strength, but he also gained his third skill, Adaptability. From the name of the skill, it might sound simple, but if you look at it from a broader perspective, it was a god-like skill. After all, adaptation is the driving force of evolution.

For example, if he stayed in fire for too long, he would adapt to fire, making him resistant. If he got poisoned and endured, he could potentially adapt to it. If he got punched repeatedly, he would eventually adapt to it, making him resistant to such attacks. The same applied to cuts, giving him resistance to sharp objects. All in all, this was a god-like skill that could potentially make Lu Zhen nearly invincible, but he knew there was no such thing as invincibility in the real world.

"Let's go, Old Bai," Lu Zhen said as they got on the carriage. However, after travelling for five miles, they encountered a strange thing.

A black barrier covered the outside world entirely.

"Hmm, so this must be the reason that no one could come even after this much commotion, huh?" Lu Zhen thought as he frowned.

Lu Zhen picked up a stone and threw it at the barrier. With a swoosh sound, the stone hit the barrier and created a slight ripple, as if disturbing the surface of water the barrier rippled. However, the stone quickly lost its momentum and fell back to the ground.

Chapter 15: The assassin leader

"Old Bai, attack the barrier," Lu Zhen instructed.

Yu Bai was a little surprised by the strength with which Lu Zhen threw the stone. It was comparable to the strength of a martial artist at the middle stage of the martial trainee level.

Although from Lu Zhen's aura, Yu Bai could tell that he had undoubtedly reached at least the martial trainee stage, he couldn't determine the exact stage he was at. While one could sense if a martial artist was strong or not from their aura, it was challenging to discern their precise level until they demonstrated their strength or through the purity of their qi in the early stage.

Yu Bai was quite astonished that Lu Zhen had achieved at least the middle stage of the martial trainee level in just a few days of practising martial arts. Nevertheless, he was delighted with his young master's progress.

"Yes, young master," Yu Bai responded respectfully as he lightly and slowly punched the barrier. Despite the seemingly simple and slow punch, a resounding "boom" filled the air when his fist met the barrier.

However, to lu zhen's surprise, the barrier remained still, without even a slight movement. Lu Zhen was puzzled, as a casual stone from him had caused ripples in the barrier, and Yu Bai's punch should have been strong enough to break it.

But Lu Zhen didn't have to wait long for an explanation. Suddenly, cracks appeared on the surface of the barrier, resembling delicate spiderwebs spreading rapidly across its entire expanse. The cracking sound intensified, resonating like the shattering of glass. The barrier's resistance was finally broken, and it shattered into countless pieces.

The fragments of the barrier flew in all directions, glittering in the sunlight like a breathtaking display of sparkling jewels. However, as the cracks fell down, they disappeared as if they were mere illusions. Lu Zhen touched the fragments, but to his disappointment, they passed through his hand before disappearing.

"It looks like the barrier isn't too powerful or complicated; it seems to be designed to cancel out sound," Lu Zhen thought, analysing the situation.

Lu Zhen felt it was natural; after all, the barrier takes a lot of resources to make. Even this simple barrier, which could barely block a martial trainee's attack, should have required quite a lot of resources to build. From the looks of things, they were quite determined to kill Jiang Xue, too bad they met Lu Zhen.

However, he thought of an important point just now ‚Äì if the barrier blocked the outside world, then the assassin leader should still be nearby. After all, the barrier doesn't identify friend and foe and simply traps all who were inside the barrier. When he thought of that point, he felt chills run down his back.

As if his speculation turned true, a shadow flashed past Lu Zhen's eyes, heading straight for Jiang Xue. Both Yu Bai and Lu Zhen couldn't react in time as the assassin leader appeared from the shadows and slashed at Jiang Xue with precision.

"Shadowsword Dance."

The sword in the assassin leader's hand shattered into fragments, but instead of falling to the ground, they turned black and blended into the shadows, becoming invisible to the naked eye. As if defying gravity, the black fragments swarmed towards Jiang Xue, drawn to her like a moth to fire.

Jiang Xue felt chills, although she couldn't see the fragments. She knew that if she was hit, she would die. So she ran at full speed, attempting to dodge the attack, but the sea of fragments surrounded her, attacking her from all directions.

Once again, the barrier appeared in thin air, blocking the sea of fragments. Although the barrier stood firm, the bracelet hidden under her sleeve started to crack more and more, almost breaking. However, before it could completely break and shred Jiang Xue to mincemeat, the attack luckily ended.

The assassin was stunned when he saw that Jiang Xue could block his attack from a peak third-stage martial artist with this barrier.

"So, you can withstand my attack, huh? Then try this attack.."

The assassin leader wanted to say something; however, a punch directly came towards his face, making him stunned. The punch connected to the assassin's face, and his previously bruised face became even more bruised as Yu Bai struck him with full might.

Suddenly, Lu Zhen came from the side and tightly caught the assassin in a grip from behind, restraining his body.

"Attack, Old Bai."

Although Yu Bai was momentarily stunned, he complied with Lu Zhen's order.

"Hmph, how dare these brat, a mere martial trainee try to stop me."

The assassin thought as he tried to throw Lu Zhen out with the back of his hands; however, to his horror, he found that he couldn't even budge Lu Zhen in the slightest.

Lu Zhen's grip on the assassin leader tightened, and the assassin struggled in vain to free himself. He wanted to use more strength to break free, but before he could do anything, Yu Bai's fists came raining down like a torrent.

"Mammoth Mauler Strike."

Old Bai's fists struck the assassin repeatedly, creating afterimages as they pummelling him. The assassin could only watch with wide eyes as every fist landed on his body, mercilessly pummeling him. He couldn't move his body due to Lu Zhen's tight grip, leaving him completely vulnerable.

Helpless, the assassin could only watch as his body was utterly destroyed under the relentless barrage of blows. His consciousness wavered, and he succumbed to the overwhelming force of Lu Zhen and Yu Bai's attacks.

As for Lu Zhen, although he felt a slight rebound, it was nothing much considering his monstrously strong body. His physique had already reached an extraordinary level. After some time, he even gained an unexpected sense of joy as a system prompt appeared in the corner of his eyes.

[You have adapted.]

[Adaptability has levelled up from level 1 to 2.]

Lu Zhen felt content upon seeing this notification, sensing something inside him had changed. Though he didn't fully comprehend the change, his instinct told him it was a good thing, so he didn't dwell on it.

He shifted his focus to the man he had gripped. It was only then that he realised the man was already dead. Lu Zhen quickly let go of the lifeless body, and the once formidable assassin leader now lay defeated, motionless on the ground, his body battered and broken.

To make sure the assassin was dead, with a swift and precise motion, Lu Zhen used the simple sabre he had to ensure the assassin leader was truly dead by slicing his head. Satisfied with himself, he nodded to himself.

Chapter 16: Faking injury

"Young master, are you alright?" Yu Bai asked with concern and doubt.

Lu Zhen coughed violently, his face pale as he vomited a mouthful of blood as Yu Bai finished speaking, stunning both Yu Bai, Little Lily, and Jiang Xue.

Jiang Xue was a little hesitant about what to do. As Jiang Xue was hesitating, Little Lily hurriedly went to the carriage and brought water and a towel with her.

"Thank you, little Lily," Lu Zhen said as Little Lily fed him water and carefully cleaned his clothes. Tears welled up in her eyes.

"Young master, you should not do such dangerous things. What if something had happened to you? What will happen to Madam and Master? What about me?" Little Lily said as she cried like a baby, hugging Lu Zhen tightly.

"Ouch! Ouch!" Lu Zhen winced in pain.

"Little Lily, are you trying to kill your young master?"

Lu zhen said while screaming.

"Young master sorry."

Little lily said as her face was filled with tears. Lu zhen was truly hurt and it pained like hell for him not because of the rebound he took but because lu zhen harmed his body himself.

That's right, Lu Zhen possessed the unique ability to harm himself without causing permanent damage, thanks to attaining the divine physique. As his constitution levelled up into a divine physique, he could manipulate his body to a certain degree. Although he couldn't shape-shift or drastically increase his muscle strength, he could use precise vibrations to subtly control his body.

In order to maintain the facade of being a mere martial trainee in front of Yu Bai, Lu Zhen intentionally inflicted harm upon himself. With immense focus and skill, he had subtly vibrated his muscles in such a way that they collided with each other internally, causing controlled internal injuries. It was an excruciatingly painful process, but Lu Zhen endured it, knowing that it was necessary to conceal his true abilities from Yu Bai.

With each controlled collision, his body suffered internal injuries, causing him to vomit blood. Lu Zhen understood that merely acting injured would not fool someone like Yu Bai, who had taken care of him since childhood. If he suddenly revealed the strength of a third stage martial artist, it would undoubtedly raise suspicions about his true identity. Which may lead to his system being discovered.

To avoid any doubts, Lu Zhen carefully planned this strategy to hide his true strength and maintain the facade of a martial artist who just entered martial trainee. He was determined to keep his cheat a secret.

The only time he might reveal his system would be if he was truly invincible, which might never happen even with his cheat. After all, Lu Zhen never believed that he was unique; there might be talents who could rely on their sheer talent and background to surpass him. There was even a possibility of other transmigrators or reincarnators, just like him, who also had their cheats.

The world was filled with endless possibilities, so he never underestimated his enemies and was determined to walk forward step by step, relying on his system.

As he thought to that point, he suddenly felt a soft sensation on his cheeks. The lips that softly touched Lu Zhen's cheeks were tender and gentle, like the petals of a blooming flower. They felt warm and inviting against his skin, leaving a tingling sensation in their wake.

A subtle but familiar fragrance carrying a sense of freshness and purity, wafting into his nose leaving Lu Zhen mesmerised.

It was a fleeting touch, but it left a lasting impression on Lu Zhen.

"Young master, are you alright?" Little Lily said, her face flushed red as she had finished cleaning the blood from his clothes. Seeing Lu Zhen deep in thought, she just couldn't resist the temptation and kissed him on the cheek.

Lu Zhen was stunned by the unexpected boldness of this little girl. However, since she liked to play with fire, she had to face the consequences.

Lu Zhen tried to bring Little Lily closer by putting his hands on her waist, but this time she avoided him.

"Young master, I should bring some medicine," she said with a smile, her expression sweet and mischievous, as she ran towards the carriage, leaving Lu Zhen.

Although he didn't mind the kiss from Little Lily, her escaping after taking her kiss made Lu Zhen feel like he was taken advantage of. He decided to deal with this girl later for now, as he still needed to see if the old man bought his lie or not.

Jiang Xue watched this little interaction between Lu Zhen and Little Lily with her standard indifferent expression. But deep down, she felt a twinge of jealousy as she observed the exchange. She didn't know when she started feeling this way, but she couldn't help it.

She knew that Lu Zhen was acting with his injuries. After all, he could have easily defeated the five assassins with just his raw strength alone, so Lu Zhen was at least a third-stage martial artist or had the strength of one. His injuries shouldn't have been so exaggerated. However, seeing his pale face and the blood he vomited, she couldn't help but feel that Lu Zhen was genuinely hurt. It was a strange mix of emotions that she found strange.

As for Yu Bai, he had a worried expression on his face, mixed with guilt. He knew that he should have stopped his young master from taking such a risky move. But he didn't, and he even went along with it, making him feel even more guilty.

When Lu Zhen first shouted to attack while gripping the assassin in a deadlock position, he felt blood boiling in him for the first time in a long while, making his instincts go wild. The aura that Lu Zhen emitted convinced him, and he punched with all his might, pummeling the assassin leader to a pulp.

He thought since Lu Zhen was so confident he should have a back up to rely on. However seeing lu zhen's miserable state now he knew lu zhen was just an ordinary martial trainee. Adding more to his guilt.

Chapter 17: Benefits of divine physique

"Sigh, looks like age is getting to me," Yu Bai thought with a mixture of emotions. He felt that Lu Zhen was taking too much of a risk. Lu Zhen still had a bright future ahead of him, and he shouldn't risk his life to kill a mere assassin. After all, Lu Zhen had just begun his martial path, and just by solely relying on the abundant resources from the Lu family, he could easily reach the second stage of martial arts with a little effort.

"Yu bai, you should‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen tried to say something, but he coughed up blood again.

"Young master, you shouldn't risk your life like that. You still have a bright future ahead," Yu Bai said with a guilty expression.

"I just wanted to test my limits, Old Bai. Don't worry," Lu Zhen said with a poker face, trying to reassure his loyal servant.

"Young master, here are the medicines," Little Lily said as she brought some white ropes that looked like bandages but were smaller in size and thicker than the common bandages from Lu Zhen's previous world. She also had a small porcelain glass bottle filled with a blue liquid and some green paste in a bowl.

Little Lily went towards Lu Zhen and applied the green paste to the bandage. Then, she carefully wrapped the bandage around Lu Zhen's body.

As she applied the bandage, Lu Zhen was shocked as he felt a slight pain when the green paste started to stick to his body. It was as if the paste had a corrosive property that could bypass his defense of his constitution and directly hurt him which shocked him to his core. After all, Lu Zhen didn't feel pain even when he took all that rebound but these mere paste could make him feel pain.

Slowly the paste seeped into his skin, he felt a stinging sensation. However, moments later, he felt the qi around him becoming more abundant than before as the qi gathered and started sticking with the green paste. Lu Zhen was intrigued by the method.

After some time, more qi gathered near him. He felt the urge to absorb the qi, but he resisted the temptation to do so directly into his body. After all, he wasn't the only one who could sense qi here, as both Jiang Xue and Old Bai could sense it. Although he was confident he could hide this from Jiang Xue, it was almost impossible to hide it from Yu Bai, a genuine peak third-stage martial artist.

He wasn't confident enough to absorb Qi directly in front of Yu Bai and risk exposing his own secrets. He wasn't a fan of revealing his secrets unless it benefited him. After all, the less people knew about his secret, the better it was.

After some time, Little Lily said, "Young master, you have to drink this now," as she handed him the small porcelain glass containing the blue liquid.

From the memories of the previous host, Lu Zhen he knew the blue liquid could help him heal as he has used it countless time to heal himself however the previous host of the body was a weak mortal so he didn't have much perception about the intricate of it but now that Lu Zhen was a martial trainee he could witness how these herbs works in this world.

As he drank the blue liquid by removing the cork of the bottle, he felt a warm sensation as the qi sticking to the green paste became active. They gently vibrated and interacted with the surrounding qi, which all surrounded him and his body. After just a few moments, he felt all the internal injuries that he had caused himself slowly begin to recover. His pain lessened a little, and he started to feel better.

Lu Zhen was intrigued by the method as an idea popped in his head on how to make use of it. However he needed some materials for that.

"Let's go now," Lu Zhen said as he had recovered enough to freely walk around.

Yu Bai, Jiang Xue, and Little Lily were stunned again. Although the medicine was top-grade enough for healing injuries, he shouldn't have recovered so fast.

"Young master, you should take some more rest," Little Lily said worriedly, with concern evident in her tone.

"Don't worry, Little Lily, I am fine," Lu Zhen assured her as they all went toward the carriage.

"Let's go, Old Bai, back to our mansion again," Lu Zhen directed.

Although Yu Bai was still hesitant to drive the carriage, he complied with his order, and they returned in the same direction.

"Not bad, it looks like after attaining divine physique, it has granted me countless advantages. It not only enhanced my raw strength to be comparable to a peak third stage martial artist, but it also allowed me perfect control over my body. It looks like I heal much faster than others because of the divine physique. It seems that the constitution is equal to the base stats of all my physical body," Lu Zhen thought as he contemplated his situation and how to improve himself more.

After all, seeing that even after realizing he was the young master of the Lu family, the assassins attacked them without a second thought made him consider his own safety.

And seeing how the assassin attacked him without hesitation, they must have been given orders to kill him if he hindered them from killing Jiang Xue. So their backer must have an equal or even higher background compared to him.

And if they had a second stage martial artist, they would have slaughtered them with the back of their hands. After all, despite his raw power being comparable to a peak third stage martial artist, it was just in raw strength.

Any martial artist in the third peak stage could defeat him easily using some tricks. He couldn't even defeat a third peak stage martial artist, and if a second stage martial artist attacked them, they would have died for sure. Lu Zhen felt chills as he thought to that point.

So he was even more determined to level up in this world; after all, to fulfil his ambition, he needed to live first.

In an unknown, luxurious mansion, the sound of cracking echoed as a table was destroyed by a furious youth. Veins popped on his head as he tightly clenched a scroll in his hand.

"Dammit, the assassination failed!" the youth shouted at the top of his lungs.

Chapter 18: Lu Ying

"I wonder if the engagement will happen or not," one of the guards mused.

"Hmm, who knows the minds of people in high positions. We just have to do our jobs," replied another guard uncaringly.

"I am just curious. When I saw the young master yesterday, I felt he was a little different than usual. His aura was terrifying, and his footsteps seem more determined than before," said the first guard, expressing his observations.

The second guard raised an eyebrow, shocked. "Do you mean that the young master has at least reached the martial trainee level?"

The first guard shrugged. "Who knows? Maybe his incompetent title will be gone soon..."

As they were talking in the distance, they saw a luxurious carriage with four big, strong horses, each about 8 feet tall, advancing forward at a rapid pace. The horses had powerful shoulders and hindquarters, combined with a strong, broad back, well-sprung ribs, and thick mane and tails. The carriage was moving at a terrifying speed of about 5 miles per minute.

They were stunned when they saw the symbol of the Lu family on the carriage‚Äîa vibrant tree. Only direct descendants were allowed to sit in this carriage, and they knew that the old man driving it was Lu Zhen's personal guard.

"Isn't the young master going to the Golden Restaurant? Why is he back again?"

"Don't ask me, just open the gates," the guard replied, and the two quickly opened the gates.

The carriage went directly towards the main palace, and they caught a glimpse of Lu Zhen from the windows, which left them shocked.

They saw Lu Zhen covered in bandages, but he had a calm expression.

"Who‚Ä¶ Who dares to‚Ä¶ beat teh ung master liek that?" The guard said, visibly shocked to the core, unable to even pronounce the words properly.

The other guard was even more afraid.

The reason they were so shocked was that as the only heir of the Lu family, Lu Zhen had never been hurt before. As one of the four major families of Phoenix City, even martial artists had to bow before Lu Zhen, the heir of the Lu family.

One day, a third-tier martial artist had disrespected Lu Zhen to his face while he was drinking in a bar. The next day, the third-stage martial artist was found dead with his head severed, and his family was all slaughtered‚Äî not even his chickens and dogs were left alive. However, everyone kept quiet about it.

"A storm will brew again in Phoenix City‚Ä¶"

Both guards thought in their minds at the same time.

The carriage stopped at the entrance of the palace as Lu Zhen came out, still wrapped in bandages. He helped Jiang Xue get off, but this time, he became a little distant towards her. As he intimately assisted Little Lily in getting out of the carriage with grace.

"Ouch," Lu Zhen exclaimed, as he 'accidentally' let go of his hand which was supporting little lily. Caught off guard, she almost face-planted into the ground, but Lu Zhen swiftly saved her by carrying her in a princess carry style with his two hands.

Little Lily blushed, feeling both embarrassed and flustered by the unexpected display of closeness with Lu Zhen. Nevertheless, she felt happy in his arms, her heart beating faster than usual. Lu Zhen, still feigning his injuries, managed to maintain a calm and collected expression despite the closeness between him and Little Lily.

Jiang Xue observed the scene with her usual indifferent expression, but deep down, she couldn't help but feel a slight pang of jealousy. She quickly pushed the feeling aside, reminding herself that she shouldn't be affected by such trivial matters and still have goals she wanted to fulfil.

"Let's go," Lu Zhen said, gently letting go of Little Lily and helping her stand steadily on the ground.

As they entered the palace through the main door, the guards at the entrance were shocked to see Lu Zhen covered in bandages. The sight left them astonished and fearful.

However, not forgetting their duties, they still opened the gates.

As they opened the gates, Jiang Lao and Lu Huang were engaged in a conversation, but their voices couldn't be heard, only their lip movements were visible. Jiang Lao had a frown on his face, while Lu Huang seemed to be in a cheerful mood. Mother Lu was sitting at the side, minding her own business.

As the trio entered, Mother Lu aka Lu Ying noticed Lu Zhen covered in bandages, which caused anger to be visible on her face. Boiling rage took over her.

"Who hurt you, my son? Tell me," Lu Ying said as a terrifying aura involuntarily spread from her body. The intensity of her aura was enough to make the hall feel as if it was shaking. Even Lu Huang and Jiang Lao's auras weren't comparable to hers.

Hearing the angry voice of Lu Ying, both Jiang Lao and Lu Huang were startled, realizing they had been too deep in their discussion to notice Lu Zhen's arrival. They quickly turned their attention to the furious Mother Lu, unsure of what had happened. Her aura compared to theirs made them feel like chickens compared to her.

Lu Zhen was stunned as he felt the terrifying aura emitted by his mother. Although his previous host of this body knew that his mother was a martial artist, he didn't know how powerful she was. He was totally ignorant of the martial world. However, he knew that Lu Ying had always showered him with love and doting.

Now looking at her aura, she should at least be a second stage martial artist, and she should be stronger than his cheap father, who is also at the second stage.

"Mother, assassins attacked our carriage when we were going to the golden restaurant," Lu Zhen replied without keeping any suspense.

"Oh, so some people have become really daring enough to assassinate my son in the city in broad daylight too," Lu Ying said, her anger boiling and the aura she emitted becoming even more terrifying.

"I think the assassination was for Jiang Xue," Lu Zhen said truthfully without hiding anything. He recounted the whole story, but he tweaked it a little, suggesting that he didn't save Jiang Xue, but a mysterious expert intervened. He also downplayed how he caught the assassin leader.

After all, Yu Bai was a guard that Lu Ying had personally assigned to him for his safety. So there was no way that Yu Bai wouldn't tell the whole story if asked. So, It was better to tell the truth first.

"Son, you shouldn't risk your life like this, especially when you have just started your martial journey. You should be more careful," Lu Ying said as her anger finally calmed down a little.

Chapter 19: Jiang Lao

"I will be more careful, mother," Lu Zhen said respectfully while secretly observing Jiang Lao's expression. As he expected, a frown appeared on his already furrowed face, making him look even more ugly as he became even angrier and unhappier.

"Brother Lu, I hope you will forgive me. I will take my leave then," Jiang Lao said with an ugly expression as he prepared to leave.

"Let's go, Jiang Xue," he said to his daughter, and the father and daughter duo hurriedly left.

Jiang Xue wanted to say something, but Jiang Lao didn't give her a chance as they both left.

"Hmph, that old bastard knows he cannot withstand my anger, so he left," Lu Ying said as she stared at the back of Jiang Lao, which sent chills down his spine, making him hasten his pace as he left.

As both father and daughter left, they hurried towards there carriage and departed from the Lu estate.

When they got on the carriage, Jiang Xue had a confused expression on her face, wondering why her father was fleeing so quickly.

Seeing Jiang Xue's puzzled expression, Jiang Lao decided to clarify things for his daughter.

"Daughter, do you know why Lu Zhen is considered as the heir even though there are other direct descendants?"

"No," Jiang Xue replied, her confusion growing as she thought about that point.

"It is because of his mother. She is a peak second-stage martial artist and comes from an unknown background," Jiang Lao said with some fear, as if he was searching his early memories, sweat forming on his face.

"Isn't Grandpa, the strongest expert in our Jiang family, also a peak second-stage martial artist?" she asked, shocked to the core.

"That's right. I don't know how that bastard Lu Huang got such a powerful wife, but he did," Jiang Lao said with a hint of jealousy.

"And she dotes on her son, Lu Zhen, very much. Do you know about the third stage martial artist incident?"

When Jiang Xue heard this, she was even more shocked. "Father, do you mean that..."

Jiang Lao interrupted her as he sighed and shook his head. "Some things are better left unsaid."

"So, we don't want to incur her wrath. After all, we already have an enemy, and if we provoke her too, it will be our doom," Jiang Lao said, his voice filled with concern.

Jiang Xue still had a bitter expression on her face.

"Although it was not our fault, what can we do? We are just a second-class family compared to the Lu family, one of the major families of Phoenix City. I wanted to set up the marriage for you in exchange for the help of the Lu family in keeping 'that'...," He paused, as he avoided saying about 'that'.

"Although I initially thought Lu Zhen was not worthy of you, but seeing his aura, I thought you two were a perfect match. However, these assassination attempts really foiled my plan," Jiang Lao sighed again, feeling angered.

"But, father, the Lu family also wants to benefit from 'that,' so they shouldn't annul our marriage," Jiang Xue said with some guilt.

"You don't understand the complexity of the power here, daughter. Even if they do nothing, they can gain some benefits just by staying neutral," Jiang Lao said with a heavy sigh. He felt like he had sighed more times than in his entire life.

"It's just a matter of how much they can gain. If they support us and stand up for us, they can reap huge benefits from 'that,' leaving only some crumbs for us. However, if they choose to stay on the sidelines, our family will be devoured by those hounds, and the Lu family will still gain some benefits, although less..." Jiang Lao said with despair evident in his voice.

"I am sorry, father," Jiang Xue said with a mixture of guilt as she felt that it was her fault too for rejecting the marriage with Lu Zhen.

"Sigh, I can only hope to gain some alliance from my old friends," Jiang Lao said with some despair. "As for the Lu family, they probably won't help us anymore unless you can somehow convince Lu Zhen."

When Jiang Xue heard this, she knew what this old fox was implying - selling herself to become a pawn in an alliance by keeping Lu Zhen's bed warm. The idea disgusted her to the core.

Although Jiang Lao was talking in a miserable tone and was gathering pity on himself, he was still an old fox. He didn't act like this just for the sake of it. He wanted to make Jiang Xue feel guilty and willingly sell herself to save the family.

In this world where individual strength ruled, it was very difficult to find innocent souls. Jiang Lao, too, was not naive or good. The only way he thought of surviving the extermination of the Jiang family was to rely on the Lu family, and he was determined to save his family by hook or crook.

However, seeing the cold expression of Jiang Xue as she avoided further speaking made him disappointed.

"Oh daughter, even if you don't agree, I have ways to make you comply," Jiang Lao thought as sinister thoughts swirled in his mind. "As for the assassins, they must have been sent by another major family. If I can uncover the people who planned the assassination, I can manipulate the Lu Family and force them to support us."

Both father and daughter didn't say a word after this for their entire journey.

Meanwhile, in the Lu main palace...

"Sigh, son, you shouldn't have taken the risk just to kill that mere third-stage assassin," Lu Ying said with some worry.

"Don't worry, mother, I am fine, so it doesn't matter," Lu Zhen replied in an uncaring manner.

"It looks like you have not disappointed me, son. Although I don't know how you reached the martial trainee level so early, I will help you keep your secret. Don't worry about it."

Lu Zhen was stunned as he heard Lu Ying's voice directly in his head. It was a strange feeling to have as he felt that the sound might be unreal but it felt true at the same time. It felt like the sound came from all sides and reverberated in his head. It was just a strange thing to hear.

Chapter 20: Cultivation Pills

Although Lu Zhen didn't know what was going on in his mother's head, he was happy that she did not question his abilities. If she did, he would have to cook up a more feasible lie to cover up, so he was relieved that she didn't get suspicious of him.

She even communicated through voice transmission to avoid revealing his secrets.

Voice transmission was a common technique in the martial world. While theoretically even martial trainees could use it, the reality was quite different. The immense amount of qi required for effective voice transmission made it a challenging feat even for third-stage martial artists. Only second-stage martial artists could use it more casually.

The technique utilized qi as the medium to create soundwave-like vibrations, storing them within the qi before releasing them directly to the intended person. The more qi released, the farther the qi could travel before disappearing, and the more sound waves you could transfer in the qi.

While in theory, this technique could be used to attack enemies, it was quite impractical and complex to use in combat. Fights were often decided in mere moments, and even if a fight was somehow prolonged, using the transmission technique to hurt the enemy would consume an insane amount of qi, making it impractical.

Thus, other techniques were more suitable for combating and transmission techniques were only used for communication.

The technique was so common that even the previous host of the body who had utter lack of interest in the martial world somehow knew about it.

Lu Zhen was happy to see his mother being so supportive of him. However, he knew that if she really knew that her son's body had been taken over by Lu Zhen, he would probably have died a miserable death by now.

Lost in his thoughts, he felt a shiver down his spine, contemplating the dire consequences if the truth was to be exposed.

However, his thoughts were interrupted by a gentle voice, pulling him back to reality. Lu Ying's soothing tone brought him out of his reverie, and he directed his attention to his caring mother, who held a small box about the size of a ring box.

"Here, son," Lu Ying said as she handed him a small box about the size of a ring box.

"What is this, mother?" Lu Zhen asked in a confused tone.

"This is your gift for reaching the martial trainee level," Lu Ying explained, offering the box to Lu Zhen without any hesitation.

Lu zhen caught the box, he observed the box. It was simply black in colour, but the shade of black seemed to have a mysterious depth, as if it absorbed all the light around it. The box was smooth to the touch, its surface polished to perfection, giving it a luxurious feel.

Along the edges of the box were delicate gold patterns, expertly carved with meticulous precision. The golden designs depicted intricate swirls and graceful curves, resembling vines that entwined around the edges. Each line seemed to be purposefully placed, as if having a specific purpose to it.

Seeing the box, Lu Huang was shocked to the core, unable to contain his surprise as he couldn't help but exclaim, "Lu Ying, are you sure you want to give that? It was given by grandfather himself, who was greatly impressed by your talent."

Lu Huang's shock was evident as he observed the precious item his wife intended to bestow upon their son.

Hearing her husband's questioning tone, Mother Lu's anger flared up. "Hmph, what does it matter to you what I give to my son? This is my possession, and I choose to give it to Lu Zhen. Do you have a problem with that?" she retorted with a fierce glint in her eyes.

A terrifying aura emanated from her, but this time, it was intentionally directed at Lu Huang, who felt the pressure and immediately regretted his words. He knew better than to question his wife's choices, especially when it came to their beloved son.

He knew his wife was crazy towards her son. Since Lu Zhen was born, he hadn't had a single chance to do 'that' with her. Her attention and love were completely focused on their son, leaving little room for anything else.

And he couldn't even be forceful because he couldn't. He was just too weak compared to lu ying. Thinking about this lu huang sighed, feeling a headache.

Seeing Lu Huang's over reaction, Lu Zhen knew that this box might contain something precious.

"Mother..." Lu Zhen began to say, his voice tinged with a hint of guilt. Unlike the protagonist in novels, he was not thick-skinned and was just a regular human with a "little more yearning towards strength."

Having taken over the body of this world's Lu Zhen, he felt conflicted. Witnessing himself being showered with love, he couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt. After all, he was not the original Lu Zhen, and his very existence felt like deception, causing a pang of guilt within him.

This experience of guilt was a common human psychology shared by most people in the modern world, whether they acknowledged it or not. Living in the comfort of society, Lu Zhen was no exception to this phenomenon, often referred to as "impostor syndrome" or "imposter phenomenon."

However, just moments later, the feeling of guilt seemed to dissipate, almost as if it never existed. It was as if he had "adapted" to this psychology.

"Son, you should take it as a gift from your dear mother," lu ying said in a stern and loving voice.

Hearing the voice lu zhen might have refused previously but now he felt more inclined to it and didn't hesitate to take it.

"Then thank you, Mother. What is in the box?" Lu Zhen inquired with a composed expression.

"This box contains a pill that can directly help you purify and condense qi to a certain degree without requiring any effort," she casually explained.

Lu Zhen was shocked to hear this. After all, pills were rare treasures in this world, as only first stage martial artists or higher could create them. Regardless of the type of pill, they were sought after because of their heaven-defying effects.

"Don't open it now, or its medicinal properties will be lost. You should consume this pill only when you reach the third stage as a martial artist to achieve the best effect," Lu Ying patiently explained.

"Thank you, mother," Lu Zhen said in an extremely grateful tone.

Lu Zhen was genuinely thankful for her support. She had not only provided him with the perfect Verdant Blade Art for his cultivation but also gifted him these valuable pills, for which he felt immense gratitude towards his mother. After all, Lu Zhen wasn't an ungrateful person; he believed in repaying kindness.

Chapter 21: Secrets behind the Fiance

"You should head to the library to practice some combat arts and enhance your combat strength. Remember, you practice verdant blade art with wood attribute qi, which has the lowest attack power," Lu Ying advised her son as he held the box.

"Yes, Mother," Lu Zhen replied respectfully. However, he didn't immediately leave; his facial expression reflected his confusion as a question lingered in his mind.

Sensing his confusion, Lu Ying guessed something was bothering him. "Son, do you have a question?" she inquired.

"Yes, Mother. I wonder about the engagement..." Lu Zhen was about to ask, but his words were interrupted by Lu Ying's response.

"Oh, the engagement was arranged because they discovered something that could potentially elevate their status to that of a major family. However, fortunate or not, this news got leaked and all the factions in Phoenix City are now aware of it."

"From that moment, almost every family has been targeting the Jiangs. This onslaught has not only forced them to close their shops but also pushed them to the brink of survival. They need external assistance desperately, which is why they're seeking an alliance to alleviate the mounting pressure. Due to their existing friendship with us, they've turned to us for support."

"As for what 'that' is, I won't disclose it to you. You must attain at least the third stage of a martial artist's strength to be qualified to learn about it."

When Lu Zhen heard this, he felt a little indignation. After all, in terms of raw strength, he was technically a peak third stage martial artist, even though his qi level was that of a martial trainee.

However, a sense of relief also washed over him, as it seemed she was unaware of his true abilities even though she might have guessed that he has some secrets and from the memories he got Lu Ying has always cared for him so she shouldn't have thoughts towards his secrets from the looks of it.

Lu Huang sneered as he chimed in, "The Jiang family is quite ignorant and arrogant; they think that just by marrying their daughter to us, they can gain our support to help them relieve some of their pressure."

"Even if we want to help them, we can't do so. After all, we aren't the only major family in this city. There are still three others who have been eyeing the Jiang family for a long time. There is no way we will fight the entire city just for them. They have really overestimated us," Lu Huang said as he chuckled.

"The most beneficial thing for the family to do is to drain them of benefits before letting them barely survive by making some agreements with the other families."

Lu Zhen now understood this whole shenanigans of finance. It looks like a silent politics had occurred for just this marriage. And from the looks of it, the family he was in now was evil, or should he say that the world itself is evil.

Even in his previous world where combined strength mattered, there was always a food chain where people at the top exploited people at the bottom, making them work like slaves.

In this world, where individual strength surpassed collective power, the cruelty was even more colder. It wasn't much different from Lu Zhen's previous world, but the exploitation was even bigger and much harsher ‚Äì cruel enough to make people's lives feel like grass, casually cut by the strong at their whims. It was the survival of the fittest taken to the extreme.

Looking at it from this perspective though his family might just be a little tiny bit kinder after all they at least left a path for survival for the Jiang family. If it was any other family they might have left with all the benefits and suck them dry too marking their total destruction.

Thinking about it he felt it was natural and didn't feel much emotion about it as if he "adapted" to this world.

"Then I will take my leave, father and mother," Lu Zhen said decisively, leaving the palace as he headed towards the library, with little Lily closely following.

"Looks like my son has really grown up," Lu Ying said proudly.

"Did you give Lu Zhen our core cultivation technique?" Lu Huang asked.

"Yes, I gave it. Do you have any problem with it?" Lu Ying said, her gaze fixed on Lu Huang.

Seeing Lu Ying's stern stare, sweat began to form on Lu Huang's back. He held back from saying anything. The Verdant Blade Art was the primary inheritance of the Lu family, reserved solely for direct descendants who had made significant contributions to the family. It was a strict family rule, yet now Lu Zhen had obtained the martial arts technique seemingly without any effort.

"Forget it," Lu Huang thought as he let out a sigh.

As Lu Zhen was walking towards the library, he heard a familiar voice filled with respect.

"We greet cousin," they chimed in unison.

Lu Zhen turned to look at the boy and the girl who were twins.

"Oh, it's you two. What do you want?" Lu Zhen asked them as he noticed their almost identical faces.

The only difference was that the young girl had a more feminine appearance and was slightly leaner, while the young boy had a more masculine face and was somewhat plumper.

They both had blue eyes and green hair and looked identical to each other.

They were even dressed in nearly identical white robes.

Based on his memories, the twins held a very low status in the family due to their mother's early death. Although their living conditions were better than those of most average people, they didn't receive much importance within the family.

They seemed noticeably nervous as they responded to him.

"Cousin, we need your assistance with something. Can you help us? I will give you the monkey wine in return," the boy, also known as Lu Zhi, spoke with respect.

Chapter 22: The Twins

"Oh, what kind of help do you need?" Lu Zhen inquired, his eyes lighting up with interest.

Monkey wine was an exceptionally rare type of wine in this world, not due to its ingredients, but because of the meticulous preparation it required and the expertise in wine making.

What made this wine special was that only martial artists could create it. During the fermentation process, martial artists had to utilize their control over Qi to carefully regulate the temperature, humidity, and energy flows. It was a tedious and tiring process that needed a lot of patience to make and consumed a massive amount of qi.

Even Lu Zhen hadn't drank this wine much as it was relatively rare in the market that every time it showed up it would be instantly sold.

Although wine didn't particularly pique Lu Zhen's interest, the previous host had a passion for it. Thus, he decided to play along with his character.

"Brother Lu we need your help ‚Ä¶" Lu Zhi patterned on and on about a long a** story before finally completing.

Although Lu Zhen was a little bored, he still understood most of the important parts of the story.

"Brother Lu, can you assist us?" Lu Zhi finally concluded after recounting the entire narrative.

"Alright, I will offer my help," Lu Zhen replied simply, then left without paying much attention to it.

Witnessing this, the twins were taken aback and filled with anxiety.

"But we're in urgent need of your assistance," Lu Zhi emphasized urgently, both twins wearing nervous expressions.

Upon hearing this, Lu Zhen paused and stated, "Meet me in the library four days from now." With those words, he departed, leaving behind the anxious twins.

"Brother what should we do?" Lu Qian asked her brother nervously.

"Don't worry, since Brother Lu has given his word, he will surely assist us. If not‚Ä¶" Lu Zhi's eyes gleamed with determination, as he thought of something while clenching his fist.

"Young master looks like they need help urgently‚Ä¶" As Lu Zhen went far from the twins, Little Lily said hesitantly.

Hearing this Lu Zhen felt that he needed to educate the little innocent maid of his.

"Little Lily, do you understand how to make things valuable in this world?" He interjected, turning towards her with a question.

Little Lily appeared slightly perplexed by the unexpected query, wondering why he was asking a question when she was the one seeking answers. However since he was her young master she replied honestly.

"No."

"It's all about 'rarity.' If you wish to bestow value upon something, you must ensure its rarity. Just like my assistance‚Äîseems they can only turn to me for help. By having them wait a while, my assistance will become more valuable to them," Lu Zhen explained, folding his arms looking like an expert.

"I understand, young master." Little lily said as her eyes gained clarity as if enlightened.

Lu Zhen was stunned, he truly didn't know what was going on in this girl's head. He had been speaking nonsense to her, not expecting her to take it so seriously. The actual reason was that he wanted to see whether this so-called combat arts could really help him or not.

He couldn't care less about others' problems, despite the previous host having formed some friendships with them. He wasn't the previous host, so he didn't care. His sole focus was on becoming stronger; other matters could be resolved later.

Lu Zhen and Little Lily soon reached the library.

The Library wasn't as big as other Lu estate palaces, but it's design was even more extravagant than the main palace.

Lu Zhen wasn't joking ‚Äì the entire palace was covered in a gold-like material, making it look really luxurious.

The outside was full of intricate patterns that added to its beauty. It gave an aura of luxury and knowledge at the same time.

The library was crowded with people who were entering and exiting the library mostly wearing white uniforms with tree shaped badges.

When they saw Lu Zhen they were stunned as they hurriedly bowed towards Lu Zhen paying their respect.

"We greet the young master." They all said in unison.

"I wonder what this bastard is trying to do now."

"He is again going to torment us even though he has become a martial artist. He must have become a martial artist with the help of the Lu family."

"Now that he has become a martial artist he must have come to brag about himself."

A person with green hair thought with some indignation as he too bowed. Almost all the external disciples thought the same way but they still bowed to Lu Zhen respectfully without a hint of disrespect.

"Hmm you have all done a good job." Lu Zhen casually commented as he approached the large library door.

Upon hearing Lu Zhen's praise, they were taken aback. After all, Lu Zhen had always used his status to bully them in the past.

Being external disciples recruited from the outside world, they all come from very humble backgrounds. Despite their disadvantaged origins, their talents were exceptionally high, which allowed them the chance to join the Lu family. Their only chance to become stronger was by becoming disciples of a prestigious family like the Lu family and complying with their demands to acquire resources for practicing martial arts.

For countless generations, it has been the norm for individuals with exceptional talents among the common people to align themselves with prominent families or sects which mutually benefit them. As the big families gain new talents while the common people get to practice martial arts. Which has led to a tacit understanding among them.

However, those who joined the families have always encountered discrimination from the direct descendants who held higher status than them. After all, families predominantly prioritize their bloodline, in contrast to sects which can essentially be described as larger mercenary groups.

Lu Zhen also knew about this and so he decided to rectify the previous host's mistake. At least he put a tiny effort into it.

This thought went to the back of his mind, as he slowly entered the library.

Chapter 23: Combat Arts

"Why have you come here, young master?" A white-bearded man with a bald head asked, his surprise evident.

Draped in a classic green robe, his weathered countenance indicated his old age.

"Nothing in particular, just attending to my business, Elder," Lu Zhen responded respectfully, his gaze sweeping across the library.

Although the library's interior appeared smaller than its exterior, the space was impeccably clean, devoid of even a hint of dust.

Books rested on metal shelves, protected by glass casings that created an atmosphere akin to a museum. His amazement deepened as his gaze fell upon the books; they were as thick as the heavens themselves.

Some of the books were so thick that he bet that even the "Shree Haricharitramrut Sagar," considered the thickest book in his previous world, couldn't come close to the thickness of these volumes.

Approaching a set of shelves displaying the smallest books, he selected the thinnest one from among them. As he held the book, he noticed its weight, feeling the heft in his hands. The cover was crafted from the leather of an unknown animal, cold and yet surprisingly smooth to the touch.

On the cover were the words "Cloud Steps" written. Turning the pages, he quickly glanced at the contents, swiftly skimming through the less significant sections and focusing on the most crucial information.

As he read the text, a clear understanding of these combat techniques began to form in his mind.

While the cultivation method itself had certain basic movements, it wasn't as profound as these combat arts. It was more closely related to the understanding and principles of wood qi, whereas these combat arts were crafted to fully utilize qi, thereby significantly enhancing the combat power of martial artists to a truly formidable degree.

Essentially, these arts revolved around refining one's body control to fight more efficiently. This concept was similar to the fighting techniques in his previous world. However, here there was a key distinction: while the previous world focused solely on muscle manipulation, this world integrated both muscle and qi control.

Although Lu Zhen could control his body after obtaining the divine physique, it was a tedious and slow process that required him to be active.

Muscle memory was a thing in this world. Although the combat arts were nearly identical, Lu Zhen's divine physique only enabled him to control his body, whereas the combat arts allowed martial artists to manage both their body and qi at a subconscious level, achieving a harmonious equilibrium.

While he had an advantage due to his ability to manipulate his body easily, allowing him to train in the combat arts more rapidly, he still required further practice.

The combat art he had read enabled him to manipulate qi within his legs, exert control over his muscles, and redirect them to facilitate rapid movement on the ground.

This combat art had a total of four mastery; they were collectively called beginners, middle, peak and the master realm. He slowly became engrossed in the book.

However, his reading was suddenly interrupted.

"Young master, you shouldn't read this book unless you possess attributeless qi," the old man suddenly interjected, interrupting Lu Zhen's thoughts.

"Then, where can I find combat arts for wood attribute qi?" Lu Zhen inquired, a touch of annoyance in his voice, though he still listened.

"Young master, for that, you need to head towards the green-coloured section of the library," the old man hurriedly directed, guiding Lu Zhen to the green section of the library.

"Here are all the combat arts related to wood attributes," the old man announced.

"Thank you, Elder Tianming," Lu Zhen said respectfully, hurrying toward the shelves with a hint of impatience.

The old man, known as Lu Tianming, felt pleased, thinking he had made a good impression on Lu Zhen, and left him to his own devices as he departed.

Despite being an elder, his status was lower than that of the family heir. After all, the heir would become the family head, so he aimed to leave a positive impression on Lu Zhen.

Lu Zhen immersed himself in the books, seeking ones suitable for him.

"Hmm, let's see now," Lu Zhen pondered as he began to choose.

Observing the plethora of books around him, he thought, "I'm going to be here for a while."

As Lu Zhen read through them, he felt a headache building as he searched through the options. He struggled with what to choose, knowing he couldn't practice everything. After all, practicing a combat technique took too long, and some were not even suitable for him at all.

Finally, he chose 5 which were most suitable for him.

[Whispering Shadow Steps: This technique enables a martial artist to gather wood qi in their feet, allowing them to move with remarkable swiftness, as light and agile as a falling leaf.]

[Verdant Saber Whirlwind: This technique combines the attributes of the wood qi with the prowess of a saber, creating a whirlwind of force that can overwhelm opponents.]

[Cedarstrike Saber Surge: This technique focuses on infusing the strength and tenacity of wood qi into the saber creating a powerful strike.]

[Verdant Grove Fist: The Bamboo Grove Fist technique draws inspiration from the wood element's characteristics. It melds strength and suppleness to deliver a potent and impactful punch. By incorporating the qualities of wood qi, this fist technique becomes a fusion of power and flexibility.]

[Ancient Willow Palm: Similar to how a willow branch yields under pressure and redirects energy, practitioners of this technique skillfully manipulate an opponent's strikes or momentum. This redirection creates openings for precise and effective counterattacks.]

All these techniques had a similar level of mastery similar to the cloud steps, starting from the beginner's level to the master's level.

He chose combat arts that he felt were most suitable for him. However, he changed his mind as he decided not to get ahead of himself and finally settled on three martial arts that were to his liking. He decided to abandon the [Ancient Willow Palm] and [Cedarstrike Saber Surge], which he felt were not practical for him due to their complexity. He preferred simpler techniques.

In total, he had three combat arts to practice: one saber art, one fist art, and another movement art.

"Let's get started."

Chapter 24: Verdant Saber Whirlwind

Lu Zhen stood upright, clutching a simple saber in his hands. Across from him, a training dummy, about 2 feet thick, gleamed in the light.

Closing his eyes, he appeared as though he was deeply asleep. Yet, his rhythmic breathing told a different story, Each inhale and exhale carried a rhythm of its own, an ebb and flow that mirrored the natural world around him.

His breath synchronised with his body, and in a sudden motion, his eyes snapped open.

With the opening of his eyes, a flash of green light streaked past his eyes as he swung the saber.

As the saber moved, a meagre amount of wood qi within his body flowed towards it, converging upon the blade. The contact of the qi with the saber generated a swirling force that spun, forming a small whirlwind directed towards the training dummy.

The collision of the whirlwind with the dummy resonated with a distinct "ching" sound, echoing through the air.

Instantly, the whirlwind engulfed the dummy, slashing through it in all directions with a fierce intensity.

Although the dummy sustained numerous deep cuts, it remained standing tall. Gradually, the hurricane subsided.

Upon surveying the battered body of the dummy, marked with deep gashes, Lu Zhen's face contorted into a frown of dissatisfaction.

"Seems like my qi is too meagre to fully unleash the potential of this combat art," Lu Zhen mused, his expression betraying a tinge of bitterness.

"Although I have reached the beginning level of the [Verdant Saber Whirlwind], my power is quite meager; even my raw strength is more powerful than this," Lu Zhen thought with a tinge of bitterness.

He wanted to practice the fist technique that perfectly integrated his raw strength first, but he possessed the blade mastery skill.

Therefore, he decided to practice the saber combat art first before delving into the fist technique, as relying solely on his talent would take too long for him to master the fist technique.

This is why he quickly attained the beginning level of the saber technique ‚Äì thanks to his saber mastery skills, which also complemented his cultivation method.

"I have to find a way to increase my qi. Is there no other way besides taking the cultivation pill?" Lu Zhen pondered.

Despite having the Verdant Blade Art cultivation method, which included a meditation technique to gather wood attribute qi, he had only meditated for a short time, and the pace at which he gathered qi was as slow as a sloth. If he relied solely on meditation, substantial progress would take about four years according to his estimation.

His constitution hadn't improved significantly after reaching the divine physique stage. Even though he exercised regularly, he hadn't grown much. Unknowingly, Lu Zhen had hit a bottleneck in his progress. This was why he chose to focus on combat arts to swiftly enhance his strength.

However, if martial artists heard Lu Zhen's line of thinking, they would likely vomit blood right on the spot.

Martial arts was a time-consuming process that progressed at a snail's pace. Some cultivated so slowly that they couldn't even become third-stage martial artists in their lifetimes.

"Looks like I need to take the cultivation pill," Lu Zhen concluded.

With determination, he reached for the box previously given to him by his mother. His fingers poised to open it, when a sound caught his attention.

"Young master, the twins Lu Zhi and Lu Qian wish to see you," an aged voice announced with a hint of uncertainty from outside the training room.

Upon hearing this, a subtle frown creased Lu Zhen's brow.

"Oh, I almost forgot about them‚Ä¶"

He had been so absorbed in practising the [Verdant Saber Whirlwind] technique that he hadn't even realised four days had passed.

That's right, Lu Zhen's initial focus was on increasing his attacking prowess before delving into movement combat art. He firmly believed in cultivating absolute strength.

While the [Whispering Shadow Steps] combat art might grant him greater mobility, his current priority was enhancing his combat power. He was quite unsatisfied with his current level. He believed that speed, while advantageous, could be easily countered by tactics such as barriers and encirclements. If he encountered a stronger opponent, Lu Zhen wouldn't even have the luxury of time to react before meeting his demise.

So he believed that strength was the way to go. Other things could be considered later.

"I am coming, Elder Tianming," Lu Zhen declared as he opened the door and was greeted by the familiar sight of the library.

Lu Zhen had now understood why the library's interior was smaller than its exterior ‚Äì there were secret rooms for direct descendants to practice combat arts.

These rooms were especially prepared for higher-ranking family members and possessed sound-nullifying properties. They also featured wooden dummies, which were highly suitable for practice.

As Lu Zhen exited the door, he saw Lu Tianming standing with a hint of hesitation.

"Young master, I hope I didn't disturb you," Lu Tianming said with a slight hesitation.

"Elder Tianming, you didn't disturb me. Thank you for informing me," Lu Zhen replied in a respectful tone.

Despite being slightly annoyed by the twins' persistence, he intended to keep his word to them. However, his main reason was his curiosity about the monkey wine. In the memories he had acquired, each time the previous host drank the wine, his body felt refreshed the next day.

He wanted to test its effectiveness for himself. Considering its rarity in the market, he thought it better to acquire the wine now. From his recollections, he knew that although Lu Zhi was merely a martial trainee at the age of 26, he was also a master wine brewer ‚Äì a skill that very few in Phoenix City could compete with.

With that thought in mind, he followed Elder Lu Tianming's guidance and approached them slowly.

However, midway, Lu Zhen's ears started twitching, and he heard some words.

"Brother, do you think Lu Zhen will really help us? Even if he helps, can he really solve our problems?"

This was followed by a thud and an angry voice.

"Just shut up‚Ä¶"

Hearing the squabbling between the two, Lu Zhen felt quite amused and intrigued by their argument.

Chapter 25: Monkey Wine

As Lu Zhen entered the room where the twins were, an unexpected silence fell upon them, almost as if the earlier quarrel had never occurred. Lu Zhen found this situation somewhat amusing.

"Brother Lu, about the..." Lu Zhi began, but Lu Zhen swiftly cut him off.

"Alright, since I've given you my word, I will help you," Lu Zhen stated and turned to leave the room, leaving both Lu Zhi and Lu Qiang stunned by his sudden decision.

"Brother lu, we apologize for troubling you, but the danger we're facing is quite grave. If you were to just..." Lu Zhi's words trailed off, as he refrained from uttering the latter part of his sentence, wary of offending Lu Zhen without cause.

In essence, Lu Zhi was trying to convey that he believed Lu Zhen might not be capable of resolving their predicament alone and that they were seeking his assistance primarily due to his influential status.

Lu Zhen understood this perfectly. From an outsider's perspective, they only knew he had recently entered the martial realm. Yet, the truth remained hidden ‚Äì his actual combat prowess matched that of a peak third stage martial artist.

Nobody was aware of this fact; even Jiang Xue, who believed he was merely a third stage martial artist, couldn't fathom that Lu Zhen's raw physical strength could rival that of a peak third stage martial artist.

The desperation with which they sought his help wasn't solely due to Lu Zhen himself, but rather the status and prestige associated with his identity as the heir of the Lu family.

Based on the story Lu Zhi had recounted, Lu Zhen deduced they were facing trouble with a group of bandits in their wine business.

Although they were abandoned members of the Lu family, the Lu family's reputation alone was often sufficient to deter even third stage martial artists from taking action. So their opponent was not simple.

"Do these bandits have a second stage martial artist among them?" Lu Zhen inquired.

"To our knowledge, they do not, Brother," Lu Zhi responded respectfully, although a hint of confusion lingered in his expression.

Lu Zhen felt slightly more assured upon hearing this, yet he remained cautious. After all, he wouldn't jeopardise his safety for the sake of others. So he changed his mind as he wanted to maximise his benefits now.

"Get me 100 jars of monkey wine," Lu Zhen demanded, his thoughts shifting as he realized the potential benefits he could gain even if he took advantage of the situation.

Lu Zhi was surprised by the request. "Brother Lu, I only have 30 jars of wine. How can I provide you with 100?"

"Then give me those 30 jars, and you'll owe me the equivalent of 70 jars' worth of monkey wine," Lu Zhen declared, his voice carrying a domineering tone. His aura expanded, filling the room, causing both twins to feel uneasy.

While Lu Zhi appeared less affected, his twin sister, Lu Qiang, started to visibly sweat under the pressure.

"Alright, I agree to your terms, Brother Lu," Lu Zhi conceded, as he gritted his teeth and agreed although with some hesitation.

Though Lu Zhen was aware that his actions might seem like taking advantage of them, he dismissed the concern. To him, it was a fair exchange.

As for Lu Zhi and Lu Qiang, they accepted the agreement, despite lingering bitterness. Unlike Lu Zhen, who had grown up in a modern society, they had been toughened by the harsh reality of the martial world.

The world itself isn't fair, and they both knew it all too well.

"Alright, let's gather some intel first," Lu Zhen said as he left, accompanied by the twins.

However, upon exiting, before he could take another step, he spotted little Lily.

"Young master, where are you going? Take me with you," Little Lily said, her tone tinged with uncertainty as she glanced at the twins behind him.

"No, Lily, you should stay here. I will be back soon," Lu Zhen reassured her, approaching Lily and planting a kiss on her lips.

As his lips met Lily's, a gentle sensation spread through him, prompting him to pry open her lips. With a little aggressive movement, he ventured into the embrace of her lips, his tongue engaging in a delicate dance of exploration. The intertwining of their mouths created an intimate connection. The softness of her lips against his, the warmth of her breath mingling with his own.

Although little Lily resisted it at first eventually she stopped resisting as she also became more aggressive.

Soon, they both engaged in a passionate kiss, ignoring the twins who watched with embarrassment.

Lu Zhen thoroughly explored her mouth, getting engrossed in the kiss.

Finally, after a while, they separated as Lu Zhen noticed that little Lily was almost out of breath.

As they parted, Lily let out a gentle cough, her face flushed with a mix of emotions. Recovering her breath, her cheeks turned a shade of crimson, a visible manifestation of the intense moment they had shared.

"Young master, you are bullying me," Lily exclaimed, her embarrassment evident as she quickly averted her gaze and hurriedly ran.

Lu Zhen felt a sense of satisfaction seeing this. After all, he hadn't forgotten about what she had done earlier, and now he had shown her what he could do.

Lily, as she moved away from the twins' presence, Lily felt dampness on her lower half which caused her face to turn even more red before she hurriedly changed her clothes.

Lu zhen knew about her aroused state but he didn't say much about it.

"Cough! Cough!!"

Lu Zhen coughed, noticing the twins standing there in a daze.

"Haven't you seen a man having some fun with his woman?" Lu Zhen said, a slightly disatisfied expression on his face.

Hearing Lu Zhen's stern tone, the twins finally snapped out of their daze.

"Brother Lu, I was just surprised‚Ä¶" Lu Zhi hurriedly replied. Lu Qian remained silent, her face flushed with embarrassment.

Lu Zhi felt a bit like an inexperienced youth* upon witnessing the passionate kiss. At his age, he had encountered numerous things, but the intensity of the kissing scene caught him off guard, as he had never before witnessed such an erotic display before.

Lu Qian was too flustered to form coherent thoughts. Her cheeks were crimson, and she kept her head lowered in embarrassment.

"Now let's get into our business."

Chapter 26: Bandits

"Here's the information you need, young master," a woman with striking purple hair purred, her voice a seductive whisper as she went towards him.

Dressed in an alluring black nightdress, her vibrant purple hair cascaded like a waterfall. Her regular-sized eyes held a captivating hint of mystery in their black hue.

Her lips, rosy as freshly bloomed rose petals, complemented her fair, snow-like complexion. Her slender figure highlighted her slim waist, long supple legs, and perfect height, adding to her elegant presence.

Approaching Lu Zhen with a deliberate sway of her hips, she leaned down to hand him the paper, her loose gown inadvertently revealing a mouth watering scene of her ample curves. The sight exuded an unmistakable air of mature allure, a captivating magnetism that could only be attributed to the realm of a MILF.

Maintaining a poker face, Lu Zhen accepted the paper, his gaze fixed on the information before him, seemingly ignoring the captivating presence beside him.

As his eyes scanned the contents of the paper, a subtle furrow formed on his brow. "Hmm, this is strange. The bandits that targeted the twins have only recently become more active. They shouldn't have the audacity to attack a member of the Lu family..."

The attacks on the twins had commenced a mere two months ago, specifically targeting their caravans.

According to the information presented, the leader of the bandits was a third stage martial artist, and the stronghold housed around 1000 individuals, most of whom were ordinary people. However, there were 20 individuals among them who were in the martial trainee realm excluding the leader. They were called as the silent vipers.

"It looks like the twins are being targeted by someone," Lu Zhen mused to himself, his mind working to piece together the puzzle.

He didn't want to get into a fight yet, but when he had previously fought the assassin, he felt like he was levelling up faster and had acquired a skill quite easily. So, he wanted to test this theory of his to see if it was true or not. However, he didn't have a hobby of seeking trouble.

As a result, he had decided to help the twins, not only because of the monkey wine, but also because he wanted to put his theory to the test.

"I will take my leave, Miss Li Jiao," Lu Zhen respectfully addressed the woman, his expression unwavering as he disregarded her alluring gestures and turned to depart.

Observing Lu Zhen's departure, Li Jiao was momentarily taken aback. However, a self-assured chuckle escaped her lips. "I can't believe I didn't manage to stir even a hint of desire..."

Arrogance flickered in her thoughts as she revelled in her own beauty. Yet, an underlying unease simmered beneath the surface, ignited by the cold detachment she had witnessed in Lu Zhen's demeanour.

Although lu zhen felt a little aroused by the woman he wasn't a person who only thought with his dick. His main priority was to get stronger, he could have some fun when he had free time.

As Lu Zhen exited the opulent chamber, he found Lu Zhi and Lu Qian awaiting him, their expressions marked by a visible anxiety.

"I've obtained the necessary information. Let's proceed," Lu Zhen stated, his words carrying an air of determination.

"But..."

Lu Zhen interjected, offering reassurance. "Don't worry, Old Bai is a peak third stage martial artist. We have the advantage."

With his calm assurance, they left the grand palace behind, its walls adorned with erotic paintings. As they walked towards the exit, a cacophony of music and laughter reached their ears, accompanied by unmistakable sounds of pleasure.

"Ahh! Ahh!"

While Lu Zhen maintained his composure, the twins' expressions betrayed their discomfort. Lu Zhi and Lu Qian, being older, still felt a little discomfort after all they have never been to a brothel before.

In contrast, Lu Zhen's demeanour remained unchanged. After all, he had watched some porns in his previous life. The sound in the porn was even more intense than the sound that were coming so he didn't care much about it.

The trio left the brothel. Yes, a brothel ‚Äì the most useful place to collect information.

Every man and even some women come here to relieve their stress. Some of them have quite high status too.

In their moments of pleasure, they would undoubtedly share important matters. Over time, the gathered information would become extensive. Concerned about information being fake? By comparing overlapping details, they could easily discern the truth.

So, Lu Zhen took them both to the Lu family's brothel to gather information, overseen by an external elder of the Lu family.

Although the Lu family wasn't prominent in this type of business, they had shops in almost every sector, including this one.

The fact that an external elder headed the brothel indicates its lesser importance.

External elders were 'external', lacking the family bloodline. They were recruited based on their talent. While most elders were at least third stage martial artists, external elders held a slightly lower status than the direct line.

"Start the carriage, Old Bai," Lu Zhen commanded as he took a seat, with the twins seated opposite him.

"Seems like today I didn't encounter any trouble," Lu Zhen thought with a sigh. Unlike the last time he went out with Jiang Xue and encountered assassins, today he had managed to avoid any trouble. He didn't want to become a trouble magnet, stirring up chaos everywhere like those protagonists in the novels he had read.

Gradually, the carriage made its way through the bustling streets. People would hush and step aside as the carriage passed by, creating a clear path.

After a while, they arrived at the city gate, an enormous and impressive structure, to say the least. Lu Zhen couldn't help but compare its size to the colossal walls from the "Attack on Giants" anime he had watched before. The walls were truly massive, beyond his expectations.

No kidding it was really fucking huge.

He bet that not even a second stage martial artist could come close to breaking through these walls.

As the guards at the gate noticed the carriage adorned with the tree symbol, they silently allowed its passage. The gate was opened, and they respectfully bowed to it.

Even the people who had been waiting in line to enter the city let the carriage pass without any complaints. Some even bowed as a sign of respect.

Observing this, Lu Zhen felt quite content. Unlike the other protagonists he had read about in novels, who often had weak backgrounds or lacked someone to rely on, Lu Zhen had a bed warmer, a great background and a cheat at the start.

Chapter 27: Bandit Camp

"I wonder what that bastard leader of ours is planning..." a bandit muttered in a hushed tone, his footsteps barely making a sound as he moved through the darkness.

"That damn bastard targeted the Lu family. We're as good as dead," another bandit growled with despair, lighting a dimly flickering stick that cast eerie shadows around them.

The feeble light illuminated the dense forest that surrounded them. However, before they could even fully comprehend their surroundings, a sudden blur streaked through the darkness, hurtling straight toward them.

In an instant, a gleaming sabre materialized from the shadows, as it swung in a horizontal swing. Directly aiming for their necks.

Before either of them could gasp or flinch, the blade made its brutal impact. It cleaved through flesh, sinew, and bone as if they were mere paper. One head cleanly separated from its body, thudding to the grassy floor, while crimson droplets splattered the ground in a gore sight.

The other bandit's eyes widened in stark horror as he watched his comrade's life extinguish in an instant. The chilling blade, still slick with fresh blood, still continuing its momentum, carved an arc of death that ended in a swift, gruesome beheading, matching the trajectory of the first strike with eerie precision.

Thud! Thud!

The two body without head fell down instantly to the grassy floor returning to the mother nature.

With an air of indifference, Lu Zhen nonchalantly retracted his saber, slipping it back into its sheath as if he had merely completed a mundane chore.

"Alright, I'm done here," he declared, his voice calm and composed.

"Young master, your progress is astonishing," Yu Bai remarked in astonishment.

The twins, Lu Zhi and Lu Qiang, exchanged surprised glances, they were awestruck as Lu Zhen had handled the bandit so quickly.

Lu Zhen himself felt as though it was natural to kill these people, like mere bugs. Ever since he had obtained the adaptability skill, he felt as though his natural emotions that weighed him down had all disappeared.

Although he felt as though he could become an emotionless monster, the skill only disabled the emotions that weighed him down, such as love, pity, and compassion. However, he still felt lustful, happy, greedy, and wrathful.

So, he didn't think too much about it for now, as he still had some work to do.

"Let's go."

Lu zhen said in a silent tone as they all moved forward in the silence of the night.

They soon arrived at the encampment where the bandits known as the silent vipers resided.

The camp sprawled with a multitude of tents, numbering in the hundreds. However, most of them appeared weathered and ragged, almost as if a strong gust could easily whisk them away.

Only a handful, about 20 or so, stood in slightly better condition, while one tent stood out conspicuously, catching the eye with its larger size and striking appearance.

This particular tent dwarfed the others, stretching about 20 feet in length ‚Äì akin to the dimensions of a one-story building. Illuminated by bright open lights, it cast an eerie glow across the camp.

"Old Bai, scout the surroundings," Lu Zhen commanded.

Without a word, Yu Bai swiftly went to investigate.

"Let's wait here for a while," Lu Zhen declared, sitting cross-legged on the ground and closing his eyes peacefully.

Observing this, the twins moved quietly to a safe distance from Lu Zhen, where they felt their conversation wouldn't reach him. Speaking in hushed tones, they exchanged words.

"Brother, can we really defeat the bandits with just the three of us?" Lu Qiang's voice carried a note of uncertainty.

Lu Zhi sighed and responded, "I had the same thought. But considering his confidence, I chose to believe him. Besides, taking down a group of mere bandits should be easy for a third-stage peak-ranked martial artist."

"We have no choice but to rely on him now, and I'll still owe him the debt."

"Damn it, that scoundrel took advantage of us," Lu Qiang muttered with resentment. Sometimes, regardless of rational understanding, the feeling of injustice lingers ‚Äì blaming others for one's weaknesses and nursing anger at being the supposed victim of their own shortcomings.

Although Lu Qiang knew that Lu Zhen wasn't to blame for their predicament, and that their own lack of strength was the true issue, she couldn't shake the sense of injustice towards him. It was as if he had forced her to sleep with him and abandoned her.

This was a normal human emotion that everyone felt ‚Äì the impulse to hold others responsible for one's own limitations and the stubborn anger of feeling victimized by their inadequacies, even when they knew deep down that it was their own fault.

Lu Zhi wasn't any better, but he still held it in him considering he was the big brother and it was his duty as an adult to educate his sister.

"You shouldn't think like that. Young master helped us solve our problem. If our business went down because of the bandits, do you think we can survive on our own? Although family resources can sustain us, they can't cover the expenses of a martial artist. And you will soon reach the martial trainee stage, so we need even more resources now," Lu Zhi said in half false but half true words.

Lu Zhen's ears twitched as he listened to their conversation, unable to suppress a sneer that crossed his lips.

These twins were quite intriguing, even though he didn't care much about them. They had sought his help, yet they spoke as if he had taken advantage of them. Despite not attaching much importance to these two, as long as his work was completed, he had decided to deal with them on his terms after the attack concluded.

Meanwhile, in the most luxurious tent of the camp, a brawny man with a green robe and a striking scar on his face, which emanates an air of fierceness, paced back and forth. Clutched in his hand was a black scroll, and his face was etched with a deep frown as he contemplated his thoughts.

Chapter 28: Killing to Level up?

"As long as I can ruin their business, I can obtain some contribution points from them," Chen Mo thought as he clenched the scroll.

"Although I will undoubtedly offend the Lu family, I don't care, as I will never advance without a cultivation method."

His eyes glinted with determination. However, a sudden knock came, displeasing him.

Knock! Knock!

"Who is it?" Chen Mo's face twisted with displeasure.

"Boss, may I come in?" he heard his subordinate's voice, although tinged with a little dissatisfaction he said.

"You can come in."

"Master, it appears that the twins of the Lu family went to ask the young master of the family, Lu Zhen, for help," a man said with a respectful bow.

The man had green hair, a half-black skin tone, and a somewhat handsome face, although not as much as Lu Zhen.

Hearing this, Chen Mo gritted his teeth and his frown deepened.

"Damn it, I can't deal with the Lu family if they take action. However, the twins are merely abandoned children, so it shouldn't be difficult. Besides, the young master of the Lu family is a nobody who hasn't even entered the martial trainee realm and is a drunkard. He should have just ignored the twins. In that case, I still have more time‚Ä¶"

As he thought about that, his expression slightly eased.

Chen Mo was a cautious man. Despite daring to meddle with members of the Lu family, even if they were abandoned, he decided to be prudent and plant some spies on them. Though risky, he was willing to take the chance.

"Alright, just ignore them and continue targeting them. And if the twins come, kill them as well, Li Wei," Chen Mo said, a sneer replacing his previous frown.

"Alright, master," Li Wei bowed respectfully.

Chen Mo wore a content expression as the subordinate left, though the subordinate himself had a frown on his face.

"That bastard plans to sacrifice us after he's used us‚Ä¶" Li Wei understood that Chen Mo would undoubtedly abandon them after they'd killed a member of the Lu family. After all, once they committed such an act, the Lu family would chase them to the ends of the world to save their face.

Although Chen Mo could run away as he was a third-stage martial artist, they couldn't.

"I must think of a way‚Ä¶" Li Wei's eyes flashed as he left.

"What are you doing here, sweeping? You should do that at the outer camps," Lu Wei harshly reprimanded a random bandit whose hunched back was busy sweeping the floor.

"Yes, second leader," the bandit hurriedly bowed and quickly left.

Disgust filled Li Wei's eyes as he watched the bandit leave in haste.

He had always looked down on the other common bandits, considering them nothing more than common fodder. They were mere ordinary men without a single ounce of qi.

However he didn't know that this was the last day he could breathe air.

As the common bandit left, his hunched back suddenly straightened, and his hurried steps transformed into strong and firm strides. His clothes seemed to morph, revealing Yu Bai, as he left the bandit camp as stealthily as he had arrived.

Meanwhile, the twins continued their conversation, completely unaware that Lu Zhen was overhearing it all. Lu Zhen, bored of trying to meditate, decided to check his status as he had some spare time.

There wasn't much change in his status; he had gained a year of lifespan and the adapt skill. Apart from those, he hadn't acquired many other skills yet.

Disappointed with himself, if he could level up faster he decided to go on a killing spree today.

However, before he could ponder further, a black silhouette flashed before him.

"Young master, here," Yu Bai respectfully said as he handed him a sheet of paper. As Lu Zhen took the paper and compared its contents with the information he had received from Li Jiao, he found them to be mostly similar, which put him at ease.

The twins had also ceased their conversation.

As he compared it, he found that it was mostly similar to what he had, which made him relieved.

After all, he had read some tactics of war in his previous life, and one of the most famous sayings was, "Know yourself, know your enemy even better, and you shall win all battles." This quote was quite renowned in his world and was quite practical too.

So, Lu Zhen knew the value of information very much. Seeing that the information was correct, he felt a little relieved.

With the reassurance that the information was accurate, Lu Zhen's determination and a hint of murderous intent surged within him.

"Alright, let's go," he declared, ready to take action. He had no qualms about killing to level up faster and become stronger, especially when dealing with bandits who had committed numerous evil deeds. Although he was being a bit hypocritical, he paid little mind to it.

It was their fault for being weak while committing crimes at the same time. After all, the truth was they were weak; that's why they were resorting to robbing the poor. If they were strong, they could subjugate others to the point of willingly becoming their slaves *cough* subordinates.

This was the harsh reality of the world, applicable in any world ‚Äì even the blue planet was no exception.

The twins were a bit suspicious of Lu Zhen's excitement. After all, it was their problem that was being solved, and some mere monkey wine, although rare, shouldn't have made Lu Zhen so excited.

Despite their suspicions about Lu Zhen's motives, they didn't care much. In fact, they were happy that their problem would be resolved, and they could resume their business again.

Chapter 29: Physician

The cold moon hung in the sky, casting its eerie darkness over the surroundings. From time to time, the croaking of frogs and the chirping of birds created intermittent sounds.

At the sentry tower of the Silver Viper camp, three individuals were engrossed in a card game, enjoying themselves without a care for their surroundings.

"We might get in trouble if the boss finds out‚Ä¶"

"As if you care. We're just mere mortals. What's the use of us? We're just decorations."

"True."

Laughter echoed as they continued their game.

Swish! Swish!

Suddenly, a chilling wind swept past them, causing a shiver to run down their spines.

Before they could react, a cold saber materialized, swiftly ending their lives with a single stroke. They had no chance to defend themselves, their decapitated heads lying on the floor in a gruesome sight.

"I will take care of them, Old Bai. You should handle the leader‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen instructed Yu Bai.

"Young master, but‚Ä¶" Yu Bai's voice carried worry.

Even though Yu Bai considered Lu Zhen a genius, he found it hard to believe that Lu Zhen could defeat twenty martial trainee realm opponents. Even if he were highly skilled, he'd end up exhausted, with insufficient qi to continue, and any random bandit could easily kill him.

"Don't worry about it. Just go. I have my ways," Lu Zhen reassured Yu Bai.

"Alright, young master," Yu Bai responded with a touch of anxiety before heading towards the largest camp within the stronghold.

"Alright, let's get started," Lu Zhen said, cracking his knuckles as he moved away to a random location, ignoring the twins.

The twins silently followed him.

Sensing this, Lu Zhen's brows furrowed.

"What are you doing?" Lu Zhen's voice carried a frown.

"We're following you, young master," the twins replied with poker faces.

"Huh? Who said you could follow me? Go away," Lu Zhen's voice turned hoarse as he subtly released his aura, causing the twins to turn pale.

"Alright, we'll go away," Lu Zhi agreed quickly, carrying his sister and heading towards a lower-ranked bandit camp.

Once they had distanced themselves enough, Lu Qian spoke up, "Don't you think Brother Lu has changed so much?"

Upon hearing this, Lu Zhi rolled his eyes. "Do you think I can't see?" he retorted, flicking Lu Qian's head with his finger.

Seeing that Lu Zhi wasn't in the mood for conversation, Lu Qian fell silent, focusing on the task at hand.

"Lu Qian use your needles." Lu Zhi said as he saw five random bandits guarding.

"Got it, brother," Lu Qian replied. She swiftly retrieved a bundle of 24 small needles from her pouch. With a precise and fluid motion, she sent them hurtling through the air towards the group of bandits.

The needles zipped through the air with a soft "Wosh! Wosh!" sound.

Caught off guard, the bandits felt the impact of the needles almost immediately. Their bodies stiffened as the needles struck them.

While they remained alive, their movements were completely halted. Their immobilized bodies slumped to the ground, devoid of any ability to move, not even a muscle.

"Your skills have improved, Lu Qian," Lu Zhi complimented, giving her a pat on the head.

"Hehehe, don't pat me. I am not a child anymore." Despite her words, her beaming expression gave her away, revealing her happiness.

"Now finish them off," Lu Zhi instructed, his voice now cold and resolute.

Though Lu Qian hesitated briefly, she steeled herself and retrieved a small dagger from her waist. With determination, she swiftly put an end to their suffering. Her hand trembled as blood stained her fingers.

"Don't worry. When we gather enough resources, you'll surely become a martial artist. Your knowledge and skills as a physician will help us earn enough, and Father won't ignore us anymore," Lu Zhi declared, his eyes aflame with a burning desire for revenge.

Though Lu Qiang found these thoughts irrelevant and harbored no desire for vengeance, she held her tongue, choosing not to disrupt her brother's reverie.

Martial artists also had various occupations; not all of them focused solely on combat, although the majority did. Some specialized in other fields, primarily due to the complexity and the time or talent required for progress, in contrast to fighting arts, which were comparatively straightforward.

Lu Qing, for example, was a physician with exceptional potential, almost a heaven-defying talent in her field. If she managed to become a martial trainee, her medical skills would be highly valued.

Even though they weren't combat specialists, it didn't mean they lacked strength. In fact, they were often stronger than most martial artists. Take Lu Qing, for instance. Despite being a mortal, she could incapacitate four grown men using just a needle, targeting their pressure points to neutralize their strength.

However, if these opponents were martial trainees, they could counter the needle's effects, either evading its impact or utilizing their qi to quickly break free. This technique was effective against mortals, but not as effective against those with martial training.

This was one reason why Lu Zhi had brought his sister along to this dangerous place. Practical experience was crucial, and she could learn and improve her skills through exposure to real challenges.

"Let's continue," Lu Zhi said as the two moved on to search for another target.

"Run‚Ä¶" a bandit screamed, but before he could finish, a swift saber stroke ended his life.

"50," Lu Zhen said as he dispatched yet another bandit with a simple swing of his saber. His eyes started to turn golden with a mixture of red, and his already terrifying aura gained a hint of killing intent.

His hands began to darken, his eyes became golden crimson, and his body grew even more imposing. His loose black robe became taut, revealing his muscular form drenched in blood, giving him the appearance of a grim reaper. His eyes gradually lost their rationality.

He emitted a chilling and terrifying aura.

[You have committed a slaughter.]

[You have acquired aura control.]

A system prompt appeared at the corner of his eyes, but Lu Zhen had lost all sense of rationality. His mind was consumed by two words:

"Kill! Mate! Kill! Mate! Kill! Mate! Kill! Mate! Kill! Mate! Kill! Mate!..."

His thoughts were entirely consumed by the desire to kill and mate, to the point where he lost all his rationality.

Chapter 30: Berserk

"Roar!"

A powerful roar escaped from Lu Zhen's mouth, creating shockwaves that rippled through the air. This sudden outburst caught the attention of almost everyone within the bandit stronghold, causing the camp to become illuminated in a dazzling glow.

"Who are you? How dare you come to our Silver Viper hideout?" A man dashed forward like a cheetah, his voice dripping with arrogance, even though he didn't bother to look.

However, the moment his eyes fell upon the human-like monster, he was terrified. The creature's blood-red eyes emitted a terrifying killing intent that left him petrified. His legs began to tremble uncontrollably, and his body shivered as he gazed at the massive, red-eyed being before him with muscle only.

"Shit." At this moment he knew he fucked up.

As if on cue, the enormous monster in front of him sprung into action. Before he could even react, it appeared before him in almost instantaneous speed which could even leave a third stage martial artist in shame. A colossal black fist materialized, generating an intense air pressure that nearly immobilized him.

Realizing he couldn't dodge in time, his terror intensified, and a repugnant smell emanated from him. His fear reached an all-time high as his life flashed before his eyes, filling him with tears and snouts.

He managed to defend with his sword, but his sword, which was coated with qi and made with the finest material, was broken as easily as a rock hitting thin glass. It shattered due to the air pressure generated by the punch alone.

However, the momentum of the punch showed no sign of waning. With an almost deafening tearing sound, the massive fist collided with his head.

Upon impact, his head seemed to burst like an overfilled balloon, the excessive force causing his body to convulse in an explosion of gore.

Blood and his organs spilled the ground tainting the ground which was already filled with blood to have even more blood.

The other bandits soon arrived, including the 19 martial trainee bandits of now once 20 martial trainee stage bandits. However, they were unusually quiet, their eyes filled with horror as they watched their partner die right before their very eyes.

"Hmph, he must be tired, attack him," Li Wei said, attempting to maintain their morale.

However, nobody moved. After all, no one was stupid here.

Observing this, Li Wei gritted his teeth and said, "Those who can kill him will receive a million gold coins."

Hearing this, greed gleamed in the eyes of most ordinary bandits.

"He must be tired. Let's attack him together," a bandit suggested from within the crowd.

"With 1 million gold, I can finally become a martial trainee."

Upon hearing this, a burning passion ignited within everyone. The prospect of elevating themselves from their miserable lives filled them with hope.

Hope is a powerful emotion that often leads people to act irrationally, disregarding their logic and reasoning.

With that, they all lunged toward Lu Zhen like hounds toward meat, their eyes burning with greed. However, a few astute individuals hung back, silently watching their companions charge at Lu Zhen with smirks on their faces.

The saying "Men die for wealth!" holds true in every world.

"Why don't you go?" Li Wei retorted, his frown deepening as he observed the martial trainees refraining from action.

"Hmph, you think you can fool us, Li Wei," they sneered back.

"If you want to fight that monster, go ahead." A bandit pointed toward Lu Zhen, who was already surrounded by ordinary bandits.

"Hmph."

Li Wei didn't waste more words as he continued to watch the scene unfold.

The bandits attacked with knives, stones, dust‚Äîanything they could find‚Äîbut their efforts had no effect on Lu Zhen. He effortlessly withstood all the hits without being harmed.

"No way that monster survived all our attacks."

Although nobody voiced it, the disbelief on their faces was plain to see.

Suddenly, Lu Zhen vanished from his spot.

"Where did that monster go now?" someone exclaimed, only to witness the world spinning around them.

"What's happening‚Ä¶" That was his last thought as his head fell to the ground, cleanly severed by a hand in a slashing position.

This time, Lu Zhen's movement was more elegant, his hand sweeping through the air like a saber. With grace, he mutilated numerous bandits in a single fluid swing of his hand.

Almost instinctively, his hand mimicked the motion of wielding a saber, executing a slashing movement as if he were wielding the weapon itself.

A small whirlwind materialized, engulfing approximately ten bandits in an instant. Their bodies were shredded into pieces, reduced to a gruesome mess of flesh.

Although the power of the whirlwind was not as potent as when he used an actual saber, it was still a technique that traditionally required a saber's motion. Yet now, in his berserk state, Lu Zhen could execute it using only his hands.

[Saber mastery has levelled up from level 3 to level 4.]

Chaos erupted in the crowd as, one by one, people started dying, their heads decapitated and their bodies mutilated.

The 19 martial trainee bandits wore frowns on their faces, while Li Wei grew increasingly nervous. "Why hasn't that bastard arrived yet?" he wondered, nervously awaiting the appearance of chen mo as he watched the massacre unfold.

Little did they know, their leader was facing an even worse situation as he struggled against Yu Bai's onslaught.

"How about we stop fighting and have a chat, fellow warrior?" Chen Mo suggested. Despite his words, his actions betrayed his intentions. He discreetly drew a pair of knives and threw them at Yu Bai.

Chen Mo's body was battered, his clothes in tatters, bearing the marks of blunt hits.

Yu Bai didn't engage in much conversation, instead delivering a full-strength punch at the assassin. His expression remained cold and resolute.

The knives were effortlessly deflected back at Chen Mo.

"What was that roar?" Yu Bai wondered with a hint of concern. Nevertheless, he refocused on the fight, understanding that he couldn't afford to be careless and let the bandit escape.

As a peak third-stage martial artist himself, Yu Bai was surprised. The intel they had received suggested the bandit leader was merely a third-stage martial artist, yet seeing his strength now, Yu Bai was certain he was a peak third-stage martial artist.

However he was the weakest peak third stage martial artist Yu bai has ever seen, he could absolutely destroy these guy unless he somehow escaped.

"I hope the young master is alright." Yu Bai thought, filled with concern. He had no choice but to concentrate on the battle at hand, facing the bandit leader head-on.

Chapter 31: Slaughter

Swish! Swish!

"Ahh‚Ä¶"

The bandit let out a miserable scream as he was cut in half.

Lu Zhen had finally managed to slaughter all the bandits.

Even in this berserk form, he panted a little, feeling tired due to the excessive use of qi, which helped him regain a sense of clarity.

However, this could be seen as a blessing in disguise. His previously golden with a mixture of red eyes now almost returned to normal, and a sense of clarity emerged. His height decreased slightly, but he still stood tall at about 10 feet.

"What just happened?" Lu Zhen wondered as he looked around at the gruesome scene, where bodies had been turned into a messy pile of flesh and blood.

In the midst of this chaos, blood flowed like a river, creating pools of red liquid that reflected the darkness of the night. The strong smell of blood mixed with the awful stench of death, hitting Lu Zhen's nose and creating an unpleasant odor in the air.

The bodies were stacked on top of each other, creating a disturbing sight and a foul smell that lingered in the air.

Although he was aware of his surroundings while in this berserk-like state, he couldn't control his body much. He could only helplessly watch as his berserk form ruthlessly slaughtered all the bandits.

Initially, Lu Zhen had planned to discreetly eliminate the bandits one by one. However, when he killed the 50th bandit, an unknown change suddenly occurred in his body. His blood started burning, accompanied by a searing pain.

In the next moment, his body expanded to a giant 12-foot size, and his muscles swelled dramatically.

Lu Zhen's expression turned somewhat bitter. However, in his current 10-foot hulking form, his face looked more and more like that of a devil.

This unexpected state completely caught him off guard. It stunned Lu Zhen to his core. Every time he thought things would go as expected, an unexpected variable appeared out of nowhere and disrupted his plans.

However, this also had some advantages, as he now knew that he could level up faster through killing, and he now knew he could use his hands to imitate his saber and utilize saber techniques.

In fact, using his bare hands was more powerful for Lu Zhen than using a saber. After all, he had too much raw strength, but he couldn't fully harness it while wielding a saber. Even though he couldn't completely maximize the power of the saber technique with his bare fists, he could still tap into a certain level of its power.

"Damn it, how could I do that with just my fist? I couldn't before, but now in my berserk state I could do it‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen contemplated the possibility, but he couldn't make sense of it.

Frustrated by the complexity, he decided to let it go. "Forget it," he muttered, inadvertently speaking aloud, though he was too preoccupied to notice.

Before he could delve into the system notifications, a new prompt appeared like a pop-up ad on a computer screen.

It displayed a blue panel with a single word and a cross symbol‚Äîmuch like a computer file's exit button.

Intrigued, Lu Zhen clicked the log button, and the system prompts flooded his vision.

[Your constitution has leveled up from Divine Physique: Level 1 to Level 2.]

[Your blade mastery has leveled up from Level 3 to Level 4.]

[Your blade mastery has leveled up from Level 4 to Level 5.]

[You have acquired the skill "Aura Control."]

[Your aura control has leveled up from Level 1 to Level 2.]

A series of notifications overwhelmed Lu Zhen, leaving him struggling to absorb the information. However, his attention was primarily focused on the saber mastery skill.

"Hmm, maybe after leveling up my saber mastery, I can use my saber techniques with just my hands."

Casually slashing his hands as if swinging a saber, Lu Zhen created a slashing wind pressure identical to how he used a saber.

"Not bad," he thought, satisfied with his accomplishment.

That slash with his hand contained the principles of the saber, which he could previously only execute with an actual saber. Now he could replicate it with his bare hands, and the power didn't lose much of its momentum.

Seeing the row of prompts, his expression finally brightened a bit. "Not bad. It's really possible to level up faster and acquire skills by killing‚Ä¶" His mood lifted slightly at this revelation.

However, he decided to set aside these notifications for now, since he was still drenched in blood and the odour was far from pleasant.

Disregarding the notifications, he shifted his focus to the martial trainee stage bandits who had been present earlier.

To his surprise, not a trace of them remained as a cold breeze swept through the scene, creating an awkward atmosphere.

Although Lu Zhen could sense his surroundings in his berserk state, he could only vaguely detect people far away, unable to see the system for some inexplicable reason.

"Humph."

Lu Zhen's annoyance was evident as he began to search for them with his still massive 10-foot body.

He leaped, generating wind pressure that launched him into the air.

"Did he leave, brother?" Lu Qing whispered.

"Yes, he's gone," Lu Zhi replied, a mix of relief and lingering concern crossing his features. As they were out from their hiding place.

Seeing her brother's furrowed brow, Lu Qing became confused.

"Lu Qian, we only have two choices now," Lu Zhi declared with determination.

"We either become Lu Zhen's servants completely or spend the rest of our lives hiding from him," he continued, his teeth gritted.

Hearing this, her understanding deepened as bitterness crept into her expression.

"I'm too tired. Let's just run away."

"Alright," Lu Zhi agreed with a knowing smile.

However, his thoughts weren't aligned with what he was saying.

"I still haven't proved father wrong yet," he thought to himself.

He secretly clenched his hands.

Meanwhile, Lu Zhen, who was in the air, sneered as his ears twitched, catching wind of the melodramatic conversation between the twins.

"I almost forgot about them. Did they really think they could escape now?"

"I will deal with them after I eliminate the 19 martial trainees. I can level up even more." Lu Zhen's eyes gleamed with greed.

Chapter 32: Aura

Aura is a kind of invisible energy present in this world that nearly every creature has.

The interesting part was that as a creature became stronger, its aura grew stronger too. Even regular folks gave off a bit of aura, but it was too faint to be detected.

However, once someone becomes a martial artist, their aura becomes more powerful and starts to influence the world around them. They can even affect people's minds with their aura. Advanced martial artists can project an aura so potent that it can overwhelm weaker individuals through aura alone.

Moreover, there wasn't just one type of aura. There could be various kinds - for instance, a distinctive killing aura or even a captivating beauty aura. The power of the aura remained the same, but depending on the creature's strength, the emitted aura could differently affect the surroundings based on the type of aura they possessed.

"Have we run far enough?"

"Forget it, don't bother asking me."

"Why is that monster still chasing us?"

"Who can say? And where the hell is the boss?"

"How should I fucking know?"

Five men exchanged curses while sprinting at their maximum speed. As the second most powerful individuals after their leader, they had always been arrogant within the stronghold. The five had formed their faction, aiming to secure more resources and power within the stronghold.

Yet, now they were reduced to nothing more than mice fleeing from a predator.

Suddenly, their eyes widened as they caught sight of a massive shadow looming over them. A chill ran down their spines.

Before they could react, a colossal fist descended upon them.

Whoosh! Woosh!

The fist sliced through the air with a tearing force of pressure, almost bringing them to their knees.

With despair etched on their faces, they could only watch as the colossal fist, resembling a meteor, closed in on them. Upon impact, a powerful burst of energy erupted, and the five were cleaved in half as if struck by a saber.

Observing this, Lu Zhen felt a sense of satisfaction, seeing that he could now use a saber even with his hands.

"So the 18th, I think there were 19. Where did the other one go?" Lu Zhen thought with a frown; however, he didn't have time right now, as the twins could really escape if he delayed any longer.

With a long jump that seemed as if he were flying, he took a huge leap and traveled at a rapid pace.

Ever since he reached this berserk state, he could literally fly in the air with just a leap, which can only be possible for a first-stage martial artist with qi, but now he could do it with just his raw physical strength.

But that doesn't make him more powerful than a first stage martial artist. In fact, judging by the aura he sensed from his own father, who was just an ordinary second-stage martial artist, he was nowhere close to his level. He estimated his current strength to be around half a step away from second stage martial artist.

Soon, Lu Zhen reached the previous location where he had heard the twins from and listened to the sounds. Even with his hearing in this berserk form, he could barely hear their whispers in the distance, stunning Lu Zhen.

After all, it didn't take long for Lu Zhen to defeat those bandit captains who are at the martial trainee level. He wasted a little time chasing them, but the time it took shouldn't have led the twins so far away.

With a swift pace, he went towards the source of heavy breathing and panting sounds.

"Have we lost him? Does he even know that we have escaped?" Lu Qing asked multiple questions all at the same time, already back to her cheerful self as she felt that they were "totally" safe now.

"You‚Ä¶" Lu Zhi was about to complain; however, before he could say anything, he suddenly felt chills as they both heard a cold voice.

"Where are you going?" Lu Zhen said with an expressionless face and a cold tone.

"Brother Lu‚Ä¶" Lu Zhi started to stutter as he felt scared for some reason.

Unexpectedly, Lu Qing was calm this time as she said in an emotionless tone, "What do you really want?"

"Oh." Lu Zhen was surprised by the unexpected boldness of this girl. He started to like her after all, as those who can remain calm in dangerous situations are always the best of the best.

If she were in his previous life, she might have become a leader, as Lu Zhen saw that although she acts cheerful and naive sometimes, she is always calm and composed even in the face of danger. Too bad this world was a cruel world; although it would benefit her a little, it wouldn't be too much, as she needed strength first and foremost.

"Alright, I'll be straightforward with you. Either be my servant or die right now," Lu Zhen said with a smile on his face. If he were the previous him, he wouldn't take life so lightly, but now that he had the adapt skill and had leveled up the skill a lot, he had become more and more of an emotionless monster, feeling no pity or compassion.

They both felt a little nervous and gritted their teeth.

After all, their lives were their most valuable possession, and no one wants to become someone's servant, especially if their future is unknown and they don't know how they might die in the future if they follow Lu Zhen.

"Young master, we will accept; however, I would like to be presumptuous and ask for a condition," Lu Qing spoke up this time, while Lu Zhi was frowning in deep thought.

"Oh, girl, you want a condition, huh?" Lu Zhen said as he revealed his aura.

Instantly, Lu Qing started to feel a little nervous and scared, visibly sweating. Lu Zhi was no better.

The aura he revealed now was even more terrifying than before, due to the aura control skill he now had. He could almost perfectly control his aura.

His aura had also significantly changed; it now had a hint of killing aura mixed in, clouding the minds of people.

As the aura was now concentrated on the twins with almost no wastage, their minds appeared cloudy, and their faces became pale. Although Lu Zhi wasn't much affected, Lu Qing's face turned pale.

Chapter 33 Volgrith

"Young master Lu, then go ahead and kill us if you don't fulfil our condition," Lu Qing said, addressing him with a cold tone.

Despite hearing this, Lu Zhen maintained a cold expression on his face, but his mind was troubled. He didn't actually want to kill these twin siblings, considering their rare talents. Lu Zhi's expertise in wine and Lu Qing's skills as a physician could be valuable to him.

With those thoughts in mind, Lu Zhen replied, "Alright, tell me your condition."

Lu Qing seemed a bit relieved by his response. She continued, "Our first condition is that we won't become a monster. The second condition is that we receive resources from you."

Lu Zhen sneered inwardly but agreed readily, saying, "Alright, I agree."

Hearing Lu Zhen's quick agreement, the twins felt a sense of relief.

"Very well, we will be your servants, young master," Lu Qing stated, bowing and signaling her brother to do the same.

Understanding that this was the best outcome they could hope for, Lu Zhi also bowed reluctantly.

Seeing their submission, Lu Zhen felt satisfied. As for the deal they had made, it didn't matter to him much; after all, they were just words. Lu Zhen had a tendency to forget things, especially conditions that needed to be remembered.

Seeing their submission, Lu Zhen felt satisfied. As for the deal they had made, it didn't matter to him much; after all, they were just words. Lu Zhen had a tendency to forget things, especially conditions that needed to be remembered.

"Alright, let's go," Lu Zhen said as he carried the two in his strong arms.

With a whooshing sound, he leaped back to the stronghold.

However, as he travelled, he thought of something important. Where did Yu Bai go? After the massacre he had committed, Yu Bai shouldn't be unaware of it now, as Lu Zhen had caused enough commotion to almost destroy the stronghold. Yu Bai should have noticed by now.

What if his identity, which he himself didn't know, was revealed? He could get into trouble due to this very reason, prompting him to make the twins his servants. Additionally, he was uncertain whether his current form could be considered taboo or not.

This realisation caused worry to creep into Lu Zhen's mind. He had no idea what form he was currently in or what kind of monstrous appearance he might have taken on.

From his memories, he knew of vague tales about people who possessed bloodlines containing the power of powerful beasts like dragons and phoenixes. However, these were myths from what he had heard. He didn't know if there even was a bloodline that could transform him into such a giant with black steel-like hands.

Suddenly, he felt a slight pain on his backside. Instinctively, he reached back and felt a thin, rope-like object. However he failed to notice that he had the twins in his two arms so where did the other arm come from?

"Could it be‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen thought to himself as he looked back slightly, and what he saw stunned him.

A small black tail had started growing on his back, seemingly out of nowhere. His face twisted into a bewildered expression as he tried to process this unexpected development.

"What? How am I growing a tail?" Lu Zhen thought with bitterness.

His expression turned into one of confusion, "What's happening to me?"

Distracted by this, his balance in the air was disrupted, and he almost crash-landed into a tree. Swiftly, he adjusted, crouching down and using his foot to strike the tree, preventing the crash.

The large tree, around 2000 metres tall, creaked under Lu Zhen's impact, but it held strong.

Using the momentum from the tree, Lu Zhen bounced back into the air with even greater force, propelling himself higher.

Boom! Boom!

Resounding booms echoed as Lu Zhen soared through the air with tremendous speed and momentum, going higher than before.

As he ascended, the random tree, standing at a height of two thousand metres, made creaking noises, struggling to bear Lu Zhen's weight and momentum, bending slightly.

Lu Zhen didn't pay much attention to it as he practically flew through the air at a rapid swiftness.

The twins were visibly shaken by the crash, landing, and subsequent flight. Their hair was in disarray, and they felt uncomfortable being carried like children by Lu Zhen. Despite being older than him, they were embarrassed by the situation.

Still failing to notice the two extra arms he had grown, Lu Zhen continued to ponder his situation.

"Wait, since it is a bloodline‚Ä¶"

Suddenly, realization struck him, and he swiftly summoned his system with a mere thought.

Lu Zhen finally noticed the alteration in his bloodline. It seemed that it had changed from "unawakened" to "Vorgrith." Additionally, there was a new section for attributes‚Äîdemon qi‚Äîbut some portions of it were still marked by question marks.

Looking at this, Lu Zhen couldn't help but feel a twinge of discomfort. As a modern man, he had always taken pride in being human and had held a certain belief in the supremacy of humanity.

Fortunately, he still retained the human bloodline, somewhat appeasing his ego. After all, humans were genuinely fascinating creatures. They often spoke of love and kindness while living in society, yet their true nature could be incredibly cruel.

Nevertheless, humans maintained a sense of unity and trust among themselves for the sake of survival. This was why, in his previous world, the blue planet, they managed to reign supreme despite them being almost the weakest in strength.

Unlike other dominant species, humans lacked strong limbs or paws; instead, they ruled through their intellect and the trust they formed with each other for the sole sake of survival. If it wasn't for this goal, he bet that humanity wouldn't have existed.

Believe it or not, humans were the most adaptable creatures.

He decided to check his status to gather more information. The question marks still lingered in the attribute and bloodline sections.

From what he could deduce, the presence of question marks indicated the potential for further growth in skills and attributes. Apart from this, he found himself unable to make any further conclusions.

As he examined the list of acquired skills, a sense of satisfaction washed over him.

Finally, he returned back to the bandit camp, prompting him to stop his pondering.

Chapter 34 Appraisal Eye

As Lu Zhen entered the stronghold, he noticed that the bodies, which had been piled together, had all been cleaned up, as if nothing had happened.

"What happened here?" Lu Zhen thought to himself as he let the twins down from his arms.

The twins were visibly confused; the blood had flowed like a river and the corpses of all the bandits had disappeared in moments. Since Lu Zhen had chased the bandits and caught the twins, it had been approximately about 2 hours, and accomplishing this in such a short amount of time should not have been possible.

If it weren't for the clear signs of battle and the damages the stronghold had sustained, Lu Zhen might have doubted whether they were even in the same place anymore.

The only area he hadn't explored was the centre of the camp, where Chen Mo, the leader of the Silver Vipers, resided.

"I should head to the centre of the camp and see what's going on," he mused to himself, prompting him to move with rapid speed.

Leaving Lu Qing and Lu Zhi behind, Lu Zhen reached the camp's centre, where he found Yu Bai standing with an assured smile before the den.

However, an oddity caught his attention: Yu Bai resembled him in bulkiness, though there was no tail in sight.

Lu Zhen's eyes widened in shock as he realized that Yu Bai's appearance closely resembled his own, though Yu Bai was a bit smaller in stature. Yu Bai's white beard, and bald head contrasted with his more muscular build and extra arms. In Yu Bai's hands lay the head of a person which he was carrying casually.

Suddenly, Lu Zhen's arms twitched involuntarily, drawing his focus. His eyes widened as he noticed that his arms had become four.

A sense of bitterness washed over Lu Zhen; he was turning into more of a monster with each change.

"Young master," Yu Bai spoke respectfully, bowing with excitement in his voice, "here."

He handed Lu Zhen the head of Chen Mo.

While Lu Zhen hadn't seen Chen Mo personally, he recognized him from the information he had gathered.

From the memories he has Lu Zhen has never seen Yu Bai so excited till now Although he was always warm and caring to Lu Zhen, he was always calm and composed.

Before Lu Zhen could speak, Yu Bai intervened, "Young master, I know you have many questions, but I cannot explain. Madam will clarify everything."

The term 'madam' left Lu Zhen in a state of astonishment. The only woman Yu Bai referred to as 'madam' was his mother.

"It could be that my bloodline originated from my mother," a realization dawned on Lu Zhen. After all, bloodlines didn't materialize out of thin air; they were typically transplanted artificially or inherited.

"So that's the case," Lu Zhen thought to himself.

"Alright, we should leave now, Old Bai. But what about our appearances? Can we revert to our normal forms?" Lu Zhen inquired with a nervous undertone.

"You just need to read this, young master," Yu Bai said, handing Lu Zhen a black scroll.

When Lu Zhen unrolled the scroll, he saw a picture of a strong-looking devil. This devil had long black hair and golden eyes much like Lu Zhen however Lu Zhen had red eyes.

What made him stand out were his four big arms and muscular body which made even Lu Zhen's frame seem like a child. He had a thin tail that looked like a heart, and on his head were tough, dark horns that curved.

In a way, the image resembled an older version of Lu Zhen, albeit with distinct features like horns, different facial attributes, and golden eyes. Lower on the picture was an unfamiliar row of language that Lu Zhen had never seen before; it looked pretty gibberish to him.

However, that stirred a strange sense of recognition within Lu Zhen although he didn't know what it was. As he gazed upon it, his mind became calm and his originally boiling blood became calm again.

Gradually, he reverted to his human form.

"This‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen uttered in astonishment.

"Young master, this painting depicts our ancestors," Yu Bai explained with deep reverence in his voice. However, Lu Zhen was so absorbed by the language that he remained still, his gaze fixed on the scroll.

"Could you give it back, young master?" Yu Bai said, noticing Lu Zhen's fixation. Yet, Lu Zhen remained unresponsive, his attention entirely captivated by the painting.

After all, this picture was of their ancestor and held immense value to their race. Every individual, regardless of their status, was granted this image only once. If it was lost, they would likely forfeit the opportunity to transform into a human and be condemned to a life as a demon, with the risk of losing their sanity due to their demonic nature.

Observing Lu Zhen's motionless state as he stared at the painting, Yu Bai began to feel a sense of unease.

"Could it be‚Ä¶" a realization struck Yu Bai, his eyes widening in shock. He hesitated, waiting with a mixture of doubt and anticipation.

As time flowed by like a river, suddenly, Lu Zhen's crimson eyes transformed, shifting into a brilliant shade of gold.

Seeing this change, Yu Bai thought to himself, "Young master is truly a genius," a surge of excitement mixing with a tinge of guilt.

Slowly emerging from his reverie, Lu Zhen's attention turned to the system prompt that had appeared before him. As he thought of pressing the log button, the prompt opened.

[You have experienced the intent of Volgrith Emperor.]

[You have gained the Appraisal Eyes.]

A sense of pleasant surprise washed over him as he read the notification. However, his confusion grew as he saw the unfamiliar language in the system prompt.

While inheriting the previous host's memories granted Lu Zhen knowledge of the world's language, the memory of this particular language was absent. It seemed almost as if something was obstructing him from comprehending the name associated with it.

"Humph, you think you can stop me?" Lu Zhen thought resolutely.

Attempting to focus on the language again, the characters seemed to blur and elude him, as if deliberately resisting his efforts to uncover their meaning, particularly the person's name.

Frustrated, he was about to try once more, but suddenly, he coughed up blood. His internal organs seemed to rupture, causing his blood to convulse, and he collapsed unconscious.

35 Blacklash

"Young master‚Ä¶" Yu Bai rushed to Lu Zhen's side, his expression filled with worry. He hesitated for a moment before retrieving a pill from his possession. Gathering his thought's, he decisively placed the pill in Lu Zhen's mouth.

As the pill entered Lu Zhen's body, a remarkable transformation occurred. The visible wounds within his internal organs began to heal at a rate perceptible to the naked eye, leaving Yu Bai stunned.

Soon, Lu Zhen's condition improved drastically, although he still remained in a state of sleep due to heavy loss of blood.

Although the pill was a top life-saving elixir, it shouldn't have healed him so fast in just a moment's time. After all, no matter how good the medicine, it needed to be digested first before taking effect.

Little did he know that Lu Zhen's skill, Gluttony, increased his metabolism insanely, to the point that he could eat steel without batting an eye. He could basically convert anything into food and devour it as energy.

Actually, Lu Zhen himself was unaware of the full potential of this skill. He had only begun to grasp its capabilities, which had yet to be fully explored.

Yu Bai grounded some ginseng with his hands and quickly fed it to Lu Zhen, aiding in his recovery of lost blood.

Finally, Lu Zhen woke up as Yu Bai was preparing the second ginseng again.

"Young master, you are finally awake," Yu Bai said happily.

Confusion clouded Lu Zhen's thoughts as he spoke, his head still muddled. His sensation was akin to awakening from a drunken stupor after a night of partying.

"What happened to me?" Lu Zhen questioned, his grogginess gradually subsiding.

"Young master, how long did you stay in the Vorgrith form?" Yu Bai asked with uncertainty.

"Hmm, I don't know, but it should have been a long time," Lu Zhen said. As he spoke, his clarity returned.

"So you mean..."

"Yes, young master. While the Vorgrith form grants immense power and the ability to contend against higher-level martial artists, it requires a fuel to operate‚Äîblood serves as that fuel," Yu Bai explained.

"What happens when all the blood burns out then?" Lu Zhen asked with a cold expression.

"This‚Ä¶ you will die," Yu Bai said. However, he quickly changed the topic.

"Young master, luckily it was only an internal organ rupture," Yu Bai said, relieved.

"When you reverted back to your human form, you were being enlightened by the scroll. It must have delayed the injuries. Now that the scroll imparted the enlightenment, the injuries instantly took effect, so you just now took the backlash of the bloodline," Yu Bai said, guessing the cause of Lu Zhen's injuries

"I can use this blood line for many things..."

Lu Zhen thought excitedly. He wasn't ignorant, He knew how to adapt to his environment and exploit every possible way to make himself stronger.

"Let's go." Lu Zhen said with a cold tone as he handed the scroll back to Yu Bai.

Lu Zhen and Yu Bai soon went through the outer area where they met the twins sitting there obediently.

"Young master, should I kill them?" Yu Bai asked as he communicated with Lu Zhen with voice transmission.

"Don't. They are already my servants," Lu Zhen replied mentally. However, sending this voice transmission drained his qi almost dry.

Nevertheless, he didn't feel much strain, as Lu Zhen relied more on his physique than on qi. For anyone else in the martial trainee stage, they would be no different from a mortal without qi.

Yu Bai nodded respectfully, his eyes showing understanding. However, he seemed to be thinking about something, which caused a frown to appear on his face.

"Have you applied any method to control them?" Yu Bai asked through mental communication.

Lu Zhen just shook his head.

"Young master, should we‚Ä¶" Yu Bai sent his voice transmission again.

However, Lu Zhen just shook his head again and sighed. He had learned about human psychology in his previous world and knew that when a person is restricted by something, they become more focused on those restrictions.

The restriction becomes their sole focus, and they might even become so obsessed with escaping it that they do anything and everything to break free, even when it seems hopeless.

If they still don't achieve their supposed freedom, they often give up, becoming depressed to the point of losing the will to live. And Lu Zhen didn't want hopeless people under his wing, he wanted people who have a flame and a burning passion in their hearts.

However, if he gave them no restrictions, it was inevitable that they would have other thoughts. Thus, Lu Zhen thought of a simple method that had been used frequently in his previous world: the carrot and stick trick.

This method was quite famous in his previous world!

"Don't worry, Yu Bai. I trust them," Lu Zhen said loudly, stunning both the twins when they heard his voice.

"Don't you?" Lu Zhen added with a smile.

However, the twins' memories of the devil Lu Zhen had previously made them tremble uncontrollably, and they involuntarily bowed.

"Yes, young master."

Seeing this, Lu Zhen felt satisfied.

"Let's go now, Old Bai," Lu Zhen said as they left the stronghold, which was almost reduced to pieces.

The path to their carriage was quite distant from the bandit stronghold, as they didn't want to alert the bandits.

Although Lu Zhen was confident in slaughtering the bandits, he wasn't certain he could prevent all of them from escaping. Hence, he had opted for an element of surprise.

"There it is," Lu Zhen pointed to a spot filled with bushes.

Old Bai approached the carriage with an uncertain expression, noticing that Lu Zhen was avoiding the topic.

"Damn it," Yu Bai exclaimed as his eyes widened in anger.

He saw the partially untied ropes that had been attached to the horses were now empty. The horses that were there previously were either stolen or had run away.

Judging from the footsteps, there were no signs of human footprints‚Äîonly the chaotic hoofprints of the horses were visible.

Moreover, from the appearance of the scene, it was evident that the rope had been cut through brute force.

Interestingly, the items within the carriage were not stolen, suggesting that the horses must have escaped rather than being stolen which made Yu Bai confused.

Yu Bai respectfully reported as he returned, "Young master, the horses have run away," stunning Lu Zhen.

36 Gorgon snake

"Let's take shelter somewhere," Lu Zhen said as he felt small water droplets staining his clothes. The cold moon hung high in the night sky, surrounded by sparkling stars.

"Yes, young master," Yu Bai said as he immediately went in search of shelter.

In the meantime, Lu Zhen brushed off a severed tree trunk, which served as a makeshift seat. Settling down, he made a contemplative sound, his gaze directed toward the twins who stood there, their nervousness palpable as they obediently followed his lead, resembling children dutifully following their guardian.

"Come here, Lu Qing," Lu Zhen beckoned gently. Despite her evident fear, Lu Qing complied, cautiously moving closer to Lu Zhen.

With a thoughtful expression, Lu Zhen retrieved a scroll from his bag, extending it toward Lu Qing. The moment her eyes fell upon the scroll, excitement lit up her face like a beacon.

"It's my end of the condition," Lu Zhen spoke in a warm tone.

"Thank you young master." Lu Qing excitedly bowed as she took the scroll with her two hands and hurriedly read it.

The scroll was green in color and the first page of the scroll had written "ANATOMY" in bold letters.

Lu Zhi, observing this exchange and the joyful expression on Lu Qing's face, he knew what the scroll was.

"Thank you, young master," Lu Zhi's voice echoed in the forest, also bowing.

"Do not worry about it. When we return, I will provide you with the necessary ingredients to craft your wine," Lu Zhen assured, his words accompanied by a kind smile.

Hearing this, lu Zhi became even more happy.

"As long as you fulfil the tasks I assign, I will not impose excessive restrictions on your freedom," Lu Zhen stated with closed eyes, settling into a moment of rest.

"Thank you, young master," Lu Zhi conveyed his gratitude once again, bowing deeply before rejoining his sister to help her learn.

"Using a few scrolls and resources to secure the loyalty of two talents isn't a bad approach," Lu Zhen mused to himself.

"Seems like the carrot and stick trick works quite effectively," Lu Zhen thought, as he sneered. Although he knew how its principles worked he didn't know if it worked or not in real life but seeing the scene now he was quite confident it worked.

The reason Lu Zhen possessed the scroll was due to his mother's insistence that his previous host read it for potential benefits. However, the previous host had disregarded his mother's advice, consumed by worldly pursuits. Lu Zhen had retained the scroll in his collection for quite some time. Reflecting on the memories of the past host, Lu Zhen felt a tinge of bitterness as the previous host was really incompetent through and through.

Pitter-patter!

Lu Zhen's thoughts were interrupted by the increasing intensity of the rain. The light rain turned into heavy rain, and he soon saw Yu Bai approaching in the distance.

"Young master, I've found a suitable place for us to stay," Yu Bai informed as he arrived.

With that, the group of four quickly headed in the direction Yu Bai indicated. Due to the rain, the ground had turned muddy, so as they hurriedly ran, their clothes became quite dirty. They maintained the same pace as they travelled through the muddy path.

Rustle! Rustle!

Lu Zhen's ears twitched as a sudden rustling sound reached them. Suddenly, a massive snake, approximately 100 feet in length, emerged from the bushes, advancing toward them with hunger in its eyes.

The snake exuded a dangerous vibe, its body covered in the usual light brown color. However, it was the way its muscles were structured that made it stand out. It seemed like it was made entirely of muscle. With a hiss that pierced the air, its sharp fangs were exposed, looking threatening.

What really stood out were the tiny wings on its back. However, these wings seemed too small for its big body, almost like they were added as an afterthought. They looked more like decorations, as if the snake was pretending to attempt flying. It was like an anaconda that had been hitting the gym hard, with muscles bulging, and then someone jokingly attached small wings for a funny effect.

When Lu Zhen saw this he was shocked however excitement came to his mind as he gazed upon the snake with greed..

[Gorgon snake]

[Power level: third stage martial artist]

Before the snake could attack Lu Qing, the weakest member of the group, Lu Zhen reacted almost instantly with a little greed in his eyes. He moved towards the snake and attacked it barehanded with a slashing motion.

A tearing sound echoed as Lu Zhen slashed downward with his hands.

"Verdant Saber Whirlwind," Lu Zhen invoked mentally, channeling his energy. However, his limited qi reserves were swiftly depleted.

A small whirlwind formed, delaying the snake momentarily. However, it quickly overcame the gust of wind and opened its mouth wide, aiming to consume Lu Qing before making a hasty escape.

Seeing this, Lu Zhen thought bitterly, "I really need to increase my qi."

Lu Zhen however didn't back away in the advance of the snake, but instead of retreating, he faced the approaching snake head-on, catching its jaws with his bare hands.

The snake widened its eyes, astonished that a mere hairless monkey dared to catch its jaws with bare hands. It intended to teach Lu Zhen a lesson by clamping its jaws shut. However, to its horror, the snake found that it couldn't move its jaws anymore, and it was unable to close them, instead Lu Zhen's grip tightened even more. However, the snake's eyes were still calm and composed as it stared at the hairless monkey like an idiot.

In retaliation, the serpent expelled a blackish liquid from its fangs, which came into contact with Lu Zhen's hands. A triumphant hiss escaped the serpent, believing it had found a means of escape. However, much to its dismay, Lu Zhen's grip slackened momentarily before intensifying further.

[You have adapted to the poison of the Gorgon snake.]

[You have gained Poison Resistance.]

The snake was now filled with pure horror, realizing it was trapped. Despite its struggles, the grip didn't yield.

To the snake's astonishment, Lu Zhen unexpectedly moved toward its open mouth, passing through its fangs and was directly swallowed by the snake. The snake's eyes widened as it wiggled its tail in delight.

"Finally the strong hairless monkey is dead."

37 Overpowered Gluttony

Yu Bai and the twins were left stunned by Lu Zhen's audacious actions. Although the encounter between Lu Zhen and the snake might have seemed prolonged, it transpired in mere moments.

Despite the chance to react swiftly, Yu Bai hesitated, well aware of Lu Zhen's prowess from his previous rampage. Overcoming the snake shouldn't have posed a significant challenge for him.

Observing Lu Zhen's fearless confrontation, Yu Bai couldn't help but experience a blend of admiration and worry.

The twins wore concerned expressions. Lu Zhen's use of the carrot and stick trick seemed to have yielded results.

The snake, its belly full, slithered away in a contented manner, with Yu Bai trailing closely behind. He resolved to give Lu Zhen half an hour before deciding to slay the snake himself.

Lacking the speed to keep up, the twins took shelter beneath a tree, shielded from the continuing heavy rain.

The snake's expression radiated delight as it tried to shake off its pursuer.

However, its happiness was short-lived as sudden agony erupted in its stomach.

Boom! Boom!

Echoes of crashing resounded as the snake, wracked with pain, collapsed against a nearby tree. The impact sent the tree crashing to the ground.

Frantically rubbing its belly in the mud in an attempt to alleviate the discomfort, the snake found no relief. A noticeable dent began forming in its muscular armour, its struggles proving futile.

"Hmm, it's rather cramped in here. How about I make some space?" Lu Zhen sneered as he unleashed a series of punches on the snake's interior.

Lu Zhen was indeed not lying. Imagine a dimly lit cavern, the air thick with humidity, and the scent of digestive acids hanging heavily. The walls were not the uniform, smooth surfaces of ordinary stomachs but a textured composition of folds and ridges. It was truly an unpleasant experience for Lu Zhen, the stomach's environment providing no solace, especially with all the snake's writhing and attempts to soothe its pain.

In addition to the discomfort, the acids were strong enough to cause slight damage to his divine physique.

However, Lu Zhen didn't care much as he could recover faster than the minor burns caused by the acid. He continued hammering the inner part of the snake with his palm in a slashing movement.

Time passed in a split blink of an eye, and ten minutes slipped by as Lu Zhen pounded the snake relentlessly, simultaneously practising his saber techniques with his bare hands.

Growing impatient as the snake stubbornly refused to burst open, an idea sprang to Lu Zhen's mind, causing a smirk to grace his lips.

"Hmph, since you're so stubborn, then don't blame me," Lu Zhen declared. Suddenly, he opened his mouth and took a bite out of the snake's inner walls.

The moment Lu Zhen took a bite, the snake's struggles intensified, and its gaze turned to pure terror as it felt something tearing within him.

With a "crunch" sound that mimicked biting into something hard, Lu Zhen consumed a small portion of the snake's flesh. Lu zhen found it quite hard to eat but with a little effort he finally chewed it.

"It tastes like chicken breast," Lu Zhen thought as he took a bite of the snake meat.

It was a bit greasy, like a goat and tough like a llama. Its taste, however, was akin to chicken breast, except for the tiny, sharp bones that gave it a fish-like texture.

Almost instantaneously, as the meat entered Lu Zhen's body, it was devoured as if a black hole had sucked it in. A warm sensation permeated Lu Zhen's body, revitalising him from the fatigue. This sensation differed slightly from qi. He sensed that his body was satisfied, a feeling of fulfilment washing over him.

In truth, while qi could enhance the body, nutrients and protein were still essential for its maintenance. Even high-tier martial artists required food to sustain their qi-reinforced bodies, and due to Lu Zhen's robust physique, he needed even more protein and nutrients than his peers.

That's why every time Lu Zhen increased his constitution, he experienced intense hunger. Without the high-protein, nutrient-rich food he had access to, he might have damaged his body, as the level-up process didn't grant him energy;it merely accumulated energy to facilitate his advancement. Beyond that point, he was on his own. Sometimes, he pondered the grim possibility of overleveling and lacking adequate sustenance, potentially leading to dire consequences. The thought sent a shiver down his spine, adding another near future problem.

As Lu Zhen continued to grow in strength, his body's demands for nutrients and protein would escalate, potentially posing a challenge in the future.

Lu Zhen had pondered this problem previously, acknowledging its potential challenges without an immediate solution. His approach was to confront the matter as it presented itself. However, seeing the potential of the gluttony skill, his satisfaction soared. Countless ideas bubbled forth, revealing numerous ways to exploit the skill which he previously almost forgot..

"Let's start the feist," Lu Zhen declared with an eager spark in his eyes. He moistened his parched lips and cast a gaze brimming with hunger upon the snake. He initiated by taking small, deliberate bites, gradually adapting to the taste and texture. As time progressed, his bites grew larger and bolder.

Although system prompts intermittently appeared at the corner of his vision, Lu Zhen's focus remained entrenched in the task at hand. His voracious consumption of the snake relegated these prompts to the system's log, rather than capturing his immediate attention.

A sharp "hiss" echoed through the air, akin to the death throes of the snake. As its eyes dimmed and its clarity waned, it crumbled onto the muddy terrain.

At the snake's tail end, a cut materialized, revealing a blood-soaked figure clutching a massive heart that continued to pulse within his grasp. On the other hand, he held a gleaming pearl.

"Hmm not bad." His fingers brushed against his abdomen, where his meticulously carved six-pack abs exuded an aura of pure, chiselled muscle. Despite his six packs, he felt an unexpected fullness, as if his stomach reached its capacity and couldn't take anymore. He reluctantly looked at the corpse of the snake.

"Young master," Yu Bai interjected, his voice laced with deep reverence. Bowing respectfully, his gaze held an unwavering admiration for Lu Zhen. Yu Bai had initially believed that Lu Zhen's victory over the snake was dependent on his demon form. However, witnessing how Lu Zhen dispatched the snake with ease in a mere 25 minutes, without even resorting to his demonic state, left him awestruck and filled with reverence.

38 Meditation

"Yu Bai, guard here," Lu Zhen said as he clenched the pearl in his hands, his body still marked with bloodstains. Luckily, the rain was gradually washing away the traces of blood.

When Yu Bai saw the pearl, he was stunned, but it soon turned to happiness.

"Young master, are you sure you want to cultivate that right now?" Yu Bai asked with an uncertain expression.

"It will be fine, it doesn't matter," Lu Zhen said as he waved Yu Bai away.

"Alright, let's get started," Lu Zhen said as he found a large tree that could shield him from the rain. He sat in a meditative position.

He took deep breaths as he gradually sank deep into meditation. His long and ragged breathing gradually cooled down, falling into a strange rhythm.

Lu Zhen's mind soon became empty as he started to visualize a blurry picture that looked like a tree in his mind.

The moment the tree appeared in Lu Zhen's mind, the qi in the surroundings began to be slowly absorbed by him. The attributeless qi in his body followed a set pattern that resembled a tree as it circulated in his body and converted to wood qi.

Actually, only third stage martial artists could convert their qi to attribute qi through the qi pathways they had established and circulate it. However, Lu Zhen could directly take in qi through his body, allowing him to convert attributeless qi to wood qi, even though his qi was still meagre even for a martial trainee stage martial artist.

The rate, however, was slow and unprogressive. Suddenly, the pearl on top of his head shone with a green light, resonating with Lu Zhen. This caused almost all the qi in the surroundings to slowly convert from attributeless qi to wood qi.

The rate at which Lu Zhen absorbed the wood qi grew faster and faster. Even the unconverted attributeless qi in his body quickly transformed into wood qi.

As time passed, his storage of qi increased, and his visualisation of the tree became clearer.

[You have meditated]

[You have acquired the meditation skill]

A system prompt appeared, but Lu Zhen was so immersed in meditation that he didn't even notice. The rate at which he visualized the tree became faster and faster, consequently increasing the rate at which he absorbed qi.

Time slipped away as Lu Zhen meditated, completely ignoring the sound of the heavy rain falling to the ground.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Suddenly, Lu Zhen opened his eyes as a green light flashed past his vision.

"Hmm, sigh, it's quite hard to reach the third stage," Lu Zhen said as he gazed at the remains of the pearl.

Lu zhen only reached the middle stage of martial trainee with the help of this pearl.

"Looks like I need more qi items like this to increase my qi storage," Lu Zhen sighed as he examined the pearl's status.

[Snake Neidan (used)]

[Remarks: The catalyst of gorgon snake power can help cultivation if the user meditates near it.]

"Hmm.." a log button caught lu zhen's eyes.

"Huh did i gain skill while just meditating?" Lu Zhen thought with excitement as he opened the long with a thought.

[You have meditated]

[You have acquired the meditation skill]

[your meditation skill has levelled up from 1 to 2]

Seeing the prompt lu zhen felt a little funny.

"What the hell are these names? They're literally the same as what I do. It's as if the creator was too bored to name the skills and wrote them as they are‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen thought, but he decided to ignore it this time since they were useless to him.

"Old Bai," Lu Zhen said as he got up from his meditative position.

"Yes, young master?" Yu Bai responded, instantly appearing by Lu Zhen's side. However, he was taken aback when he sensed Lu Zhen's aura.

"His aura hasn't increased much?" Yu Bai thought, visibly frowning.

After Lu Zhen acquired the aura control skill, he deliberately kept his aura weak, embracing the tactic of "play the pig, eat the tiger". He had read about protagonists using this strategy in many novels and was curious to test it himself.

"Oh poor souls don't meet me or I will slaughter your whole generation." Lu zhen thought with an evil smirk.

"Let's go," Lu Zhen said, picking up the snake's heart from the ground as they departed.

Nearby, Lu Zhen had concealed the massive snake's body in a makeshift cave created with Yu Bai's assistance. Although not a perfect solution, considering the snake's value and the scent it emitted, there was a risk of wild animals discovering and devouring it or even humans discovering it. Despite the imperfections, Lu Zhen had no better options at the moment. Without a storage bag or similar items, he could only hide the corpse and hope it remained untouched until an escort arrived.

"Do you know how such a massive Qi beast can still exist in this forest, Old Bai?" Lu Zhen asked, a frown creasing his face as they continued to travel.

"I don't know, young master," Yu Bai replied with a matching frown.

The Snake Forest, which they were currently in, was recognized for harbouring beasts no more advanced than the martial trainee stage. This was due to the depletion of resources caused by the constant hunting and resource plundering carried out by everyone who ventured into the forest. Even if there were third-stage martial beasts, they were quickly hunted down due to the value they held.

Apart from martial cultivation and combat arts, beasts were highly prized resources. They provided a rich source of protein and nutrients, and countless treasures could be derived from them.

Lu Zhen then proceeded to gather the twins and search for a place to rest. His intention was to take a break, not due to physical exhaustion, but rather mental fatigue brought on by the encounters with the snakes and his cultivation efforts. The process had proven mentally taxing for him.

"Master, over there," Yu Bai pointed towards an old, dilapidated temple in the distance.

The temple was constructed from bamboo and clay, showing clear signs of age and decay, revealing its antiquity.

"Huh, there's smoke," Lu Zhen observed, narrowing his eyes.

"There was none when I previously scouted the area, young master," Yu Bai stated, visibly shocked by Lu Zhen's observation. Even he could only see the temple's outline from here.

39 Xia Long

"Master, there are people," Xia Jiang whispered, his hand inching towards the hilt of his sword, and he gestured towards his neck with a slicing motion.

With his hair bleached white by age, his countenance etched with deep wrinkles, and his hunched back giving him the appearance of one on the brink of death, he seemed frail at first glance. However, the passive aura he exuded was nothing short of terrifying, casting doubt on how the hell did he look like a man with half a foot in grave.

"We are from the Xia clan. How could we be so cruel to anyone?" Xia Long said, his voice oozing false charm as he opened his fans. They revealed a black dragon picture, but his eyes told a different tale. They flashed with a malevolent glint, clearly signalling Xia Jing's ominous presence.

With a classical fake smile, he performed the action. His lips curved unnaturally, forming a smile that seemed polite on the surface but concealed hidden intentions. His gaze then turned to his left, fixing that same smile on his face as he looked at a beautiful woman seated cross-legged nearby, a hint of lust sparkling in his eyes.

Her eyes, a deep shade of obsidian, held an enigmatic allure that seemed to penetrate one's soul. Cascading down her back like a midnight waterfall, her hair flowed in a mesmerizing shade of blue, contrasting vividly against her snow white skin. Her lips, a vivid hue of crimson reminiscent of ripe peaches, added a touch of sensuality to her otherwise ethereal beauty.

Seated gracefully with her legs crossed, she exuded an aura of poise and grace. Her slender form was nothing short of perfection, with a waist so delicate that even the slightest movement caused her twin mountain comparable to mount everest to sway to gently rise and fall, captivating onlookers with their mesmerizing rhythm. The stark contrast of her black qipao attire against her porcelain skin only enhanced her seductive allure, leaving anyone who beheld her in a state of helpless fascination. She was the embodiment of every man's most fervent and intoxicating dreams, a vision of temptation that was impossible to resist.

"Sister, how about you give me the Eye of Maya?" Xia Long suggested a smile masking his lust.

Hearing this Xia Mei frowned visible as she opened her eyes.

"When we reach there only then I will give you the eye of Maya." Xia Mei said with a harsh tone arrogantly.

Although she spoke in a harsh tone, her seductive voice and lips added an alluring quality to her. In Xia Long's eyes, it only made her more captivating in his lust filled brain.

Her movement caused her bouncy twin mountain peaks to jiggle even more creating a mouth watering scene that left Xia Long's eyes to be filled with lust.

"I'll follow my elder sister," Xia Long said as he bowed, his fake smile growing wider. His hidden left hand clenched tightly beneath his sleeves.

20:45

"Humph, this woman thinks highly of herself just because she joined the Pink Autumn Sect. Does she believe she can simply order me around due to her disciple status and slightly better talent?"

However when he thought of the delicious body of his sister as soon her body would be moaning under him he couldn't help but feel a sense of croaked satisfaction welling up in him. As he imagined the scenario that will be happening soon he was filled with impatience.

His thoughts were interrupted by the footsteps of people that Xia Jiang told about. This interruption fueled his anger and resentment. Were it not for the need to maintain a facade of kindness in front of Xia Mei, he would have subjected them to excruciating torture, making them wish they had never been born into this world.

However, masking his inner turmoil with a classical smile, Xia Long instructed Xia Jiang, "Just inform them that we are present and gently persuade them to leave. In case of a genuine emergency, they may stay but must maintain a considerable distance from us."

As he spoke with apparent magnanimity, a cruel smile danced on his lips. This smile conveyed an unspoken message to Xia Jiang about what should be done once they had successfully discouraged the unwelcome guests.

Xia Jiang grasped his young master's intentions, as he had carried out such tasks countless times.

After all, how could he simply allow some audacious commoners to disturb him? He had always been one to seek revenge, and he had left many to die by torturing them just because they merely crossed his path. How could he let a random individual disrupt his delightful fantasy of filling his sister with his essence as she moaned beneath him?

"Yes, young master," Xia Jiang replied, a smirk curling on his lips.

However, before Xia Jiang could even rise, the footsteps hastened, and they quickly arrived, leaving no opportunity for Xia Jiang to 'drive them away.' This caused a rare frown to mar Xia Long's face, mixed with annoyance, as his composed demeanor slipped.

Yet, it disappeared the moment he saw who the man was. His face contorted into visible shock.

A burly man, his clothes stained with dried blood, pushed open the half-broken door of the temple with a creaking sound. The man's aura was rather ordinary, but the tattered robe he wore revealed his well-defined, muscle-bound physique devoid of excess fat. He carried a simple black sabre in his waist, which appeared dusty, as if it hadn't been used in a long while.

Xia Long rubbed his eyes, but the sight remained unchanged.

"This is Brother Lu?" Xia Long questioned in disbelief.

"Let's rest here," Lu Zhen declared as he entered, followed by Yu Bai and the twins, who ignored Xia Long.

Upon entering, Lu Zhen's gaze was captivated by a woman who stirred a desire within him, making him feel strangely compelled to make her his completely his. Which made him feel strange. While he had always been drawn to beautiful women, this attraction felt deeper, as if originating from the very depths of his being.

"Mate! Mate!..."

Suddenly desires filled his mind that he felt previously opened up as his eyes lost clarity for a split second. But thankfully it turned back to normal as he regained his composure. However, unlike the previous incident, he managed to control his desire effectively, preventing himself from losing control.

His face contorted into a frown as he thought, "I will have to get my hands on that ancestor's scroll."

"Looks like I have to ask my mother for it."

This train of thought, though it may have seemed lengthy, took only a second for Lu Zhen. He sat down in a corner, meditating, with the trio following suit.

"Brother Lu, how did you end up in such a dirty place?" Xia Long inquired, his fake smile replacing the momentary anger he felt at being ignored.

"This guy ruined my plan with that Jiang Xue assassination, and now he's become a martial trainee," Xia Long seethed with anger, though he maintained his composure. He still saw Lu Zhen as an inferior being.

Lu Zhen continued to ignore him, sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed.

Seeing this, Xia Long's anger intensified. Even if Lu Zhen had become a martial trainee, what did it matter? Xia Long had been one for two years now and believed he could defeat Lu Zhen. As for the old protector, who was barely at the third stage of martial arts, Xia Jiang could handle him.

Though he didn't possess clear intelligence about how these individuals had thwarted his assassination squad, which he had established with vast resources, he assumed it was due to an external expert. Now that he knew they were alone, it was a chance for vengeance. He was confident he could deal with them.

With this in mind, an idea formed to eliminate the person who dared to disrespect him and had foiled his plans before.

"Young Master Lu, why don't you accompany us in the search for the treasure?" Xia Long inquired, his smirk harboring wicked intent.

"Once you join, you won't leave alive," he added silently, plotting his revenge.

Lu Zhen finally opened his eyes, clearly interested.

"What kind of treasure?" he inquired.

Xia Mei frowned when she heard this but remained silent, allowing her brother to speak.

"Young master, we are looking for a Delphinium, and I know the location of the place. However, I will need some assistance. How about you come along with us?" Xia Long said with a smile.

"Alright, I will help," Lu Zhen replied with a strange glint in his eyes.

From the memories he had, Xia Long was a friend of his previous host who had pretended to be friendly while feeding him alcohol, which had led to the previous host's addiction to gambling and alcohol. Now, sensing malicious intentions from Xia Long and drawing from his knowledge of novels, Lu Zhen had a gut feeling that this guy was a minor villain. He decided to eliminate him during the treasure hunt, to pay tribute to his previous host and whether or not the woman would meet the same fate depended on the situation.

"Today will be your last day. Act as pretentious as possible," he thought to himself.

40 Xia Mei

"Alright then, Brother Lu, we will go after the rain ends," Xia Lao said as he looked at the rain still falling heavily, with thunderclouds forming and lightning occasionally flashing.

The temple barely provided cover from the rain, with small water droplets leaking from the bamboo rooftop as they huddled near the fire, seeking warmth.

Yu Bai and Xia Jiang stood alert, carefully sitting opposite each other.

Xia mei kept her eyes closed, maintaining a meditative position, while Lu Zhen did the same.

Xia Long and the twins sat across from the fire, sharing its warmth.

There were silence which created an awards moment in the situation as no one talked however this time lu zhen couldn't give a sh*t. He had a more important job as he looked at his blue panel.

"Oh, I forgot about the gluttony skill. It looks like it levelled up when I defeated the snake." Lu Zhen's face contorted into a frown when he saw that three of his skills were capped at level 2.

"Levelling up takes longer and longer as my level increases. I need to find an exploit to maintain a faster levelling speed‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen thought with bitterness.

"Young Master Lu," Xia Mei said, looking at Lu Zhen with her abyss-like eyes.

She, who had been sitting cross-legged, approached Lu Zhen.

"Huh, what do you want?" Lu Zhen replied unpleasantly, irritated by Xia Mei's sudden interruption.

"Young Master, I am sorry if I offended you, but are you really a martial trainee martial artist?" Xia Mei asked, her tone filled with doubt.

"Yes, I am," Lu Zhen replied, puzzled by her abrupt question.

As his mind cleared a bit, he noticed the woman who had triggered his earlier outburst standing before him. She still stirred his lust, albeit to a lesser extent.

"Miss, who are you?" Lu Zhen inquired, searching his memories for anyone resembling this woman, but he couldn't recall anyone who matched her description.

Xia Long was taken aback by Xia Mei's unexpected politeness towards Lu Zhen.

"What's this bitch up to now?" he wondered but remained silent, listening attentively with a smile on his face, although he clenched his hands.

Xia Mei's eyes flashed with a strange colour.

"How can he be a martial trainee with the sense of danger I am feeling?" Xia Mei thought as her black eyes sparkled with a golden glow. She observed a black and strange golden fire with a hint of pink mixed in around Lu Zhen, burning like a beacon in the night.

Xia Mei had a little secret she had never shared with anyone, not even her father: She could see a strange fire around people, which conveyed their relative strength and danger level. The stronger someone was, the brighter their aura appeared.

These colours of people varied depending on their nature. She had categorised them based on the colours they exhibited. Black usually means they are a cold person and a killer who has killed hundreds. Golden, on the other hand, signified individuals destined for greatness, rulers who could conquer even the heavens, at least as far as she could discern they were born conquerors.

Turning her gaze to her brother, she noticed a pink aura surrounding him. However, her brother appeared quite weak compared to her; his aura was barely visible. Pink, in her observations, denoted those who were overly lustful, which was no surprise considering her brother's reputation.

She had always known her brother harboured an insatiable lust for her, even from their childhood. However, she had managed to escape his advances with him being the heir of xia family she couldn't even do anything.

Fortunately, she had earned an opportunity to join the Pink Autumn Sect due to her talent and hard work, which had helped her maintain her purity till now.

And now, having become an inner disciple of the sect, she held the belief that her brother would finally stop pursuing her. As to not offend the sect however little she knew that her brother's idiocy reached a level that she couldn't even comprehend as all he thought about was lust.

She joined this trip with Xia Long because she needed Delphinium, a vital ingredient for her combat skill, the [Ethereal Frostblade]. This skill allowed a martial artist to release an icy cold temperature which could directly freeze the opponent; it didn't even need a medium to travel. Once, a practitioner of this combat art managed to defeat a third-stage martial artist while still at the martial trainee stage. Although the third-stage martial artist was heavily injured, this achievement was terrifying in itself.

Mastering this combat art would significantly enhance her combat prowess, boosting her overall abilities and greatly improving her odds of attaining the status of a core disciple.

Core disciples were highly regarded in the sect, and attaining that status would grant her immense resources and prestige, even within her own family. Her family would have no choice but to respect her.

At first, she had hoped to obtain it from the sect, but to her disappointment, the sect didn't possess any Delphinium. Even if they did, it would have cost an exorbitant sum that she could barely afford, despite her careful budgeting from her cultivation savings. The demand for it was so high that any available stock was quickly sold out, leaving her with no realistic chance of acquiring it.

When she had returned home for a visit during the winter, she had informed her family about her need for Delphinium. She didn't have high hopes, but she wanted to exhaust all possibilities. Unexpectedly, her brother Xia Long had claimed to have found the Delphinium during his adventures, though it had not fully grown so he had drawn a map to get it when it fully matured. So she had made a deal to trade eye of Maya which was a precious cultivation item which could help to increase the cultivation speed for the delphinium.

"Brother Lu, this is my sister, who joined the Pink Autumn Sect to cultivate," Xia Long introduced her, unable to hide his jealousy and anger as he watched her staring at Lu Zhen as if lovestruck.

"I've heard about the talented individual who joined the Pink Autumn Sect to become their disciple," Lu Zhen remarked, extending a greeting.

Xia Mei had a frown on her face when she noticed her brother's disturbance. She glared at Xia Long for a moment before turning her attention back to Lu Zhen.

"Young Master Lu, I've heard great things about you. It is my honour to let Young Master Lu carry out our task," she said, her lips forming a seductive smile. Her body swayed slightly, causing her cleavage to move, and her voice took on a seductive tone.

"As long as you can help us I can give you a qi item."

She wanted to establish a friendship with Lu Zhen, as he was the heir of the Lu family. The Xia and Lu families were both major families in the city, alongside the Jia and Huang families. Based on what she had observed, Lu Zhen's strength was comparable to that of a third stage martial artist, and he even surpassed most ordinary third-stage practitioners. Despite the rumours of him being a drunkard and a trash, which had left a bad impression on her, seeing him in person had made her doubt the authenticity of those rumors.

This ignited a desire within Lu Zhen. However, he didn't reply to her and remained silent, giving her a meaningful look.

"Young master..." Xia Mei was about to continue, but she noticed that Lu Zhen was staring intently behind her, which stunned her.

When she looked back, she saw the two twins cutting meat as they prepared food. Lu Zhen ignored her and, with a hint of curiosity, went to the twins, who were preparing wooden skewers and marinating the meat.

She examined herself, but her confidence was slightly shaken when she realized that Lu Zhen was completely ignoring her. She was accustomed to men lusting after her like dogs in heat, and she was confident in her beauty.

Lu Zhi skillfully handled the task while Lu Qing assisted her brother with some activities.

"Let me try," Lu Zhen asked as he observed them closely.

Hearing their new master's voice, the twins immediately stood up, bowed, and said, "Yes, Young Master," although they wore confused expressions.

The twins had already prepared all the necessary steps for skewering the meat, so Lu Zhen only needed to place the skewer on the rock and let it cook in the heat. However, he frowned when he only saw salt in the meat.

"Where are the other seasonings?" Lu Zhen inquired.

"Young Master, we don't have the seasonings," the twins replied respectfully.

"Actually, Young Master, even the salt was hard to come by. We only had some because Lu Zhi happened to have some in his pouch, allowing us to use it on the meat," Lu Qing added respectfully.

41 Cooking Skill?

Lu Zhen looked around, his eyes flashing with a golden hue similar to Xia Mei's, but with a more foreboding intensity.

As he gazed at his surroundings, a palpable aura of power began to radiate from him, causing Xia Mei, who stood nearby, to shudder involuntarily. The sensation was so overwhelming that her instincts kicked in, urging her to bow in reverence before him.

A strange, familiar feeling surged within her. It was as if something deep within her recognized and compelled her to worship him. Her body trembled with the instinctual desire, but she fought it with all her strength. She stole a quick glance around, only to find that everyone else seemed completely unaffected, leaving her in a state of bewilderment.

"These eyes are similar to mine," Xia Mei thought, startled as she glimpsed Lu Zhen's eyes in a corner.

"This‚Ä¶ this‚Ä¶" Xia Mei was shaken to her core as she contemplated the reason for this.

"Is he also similar to me?" she pondered, a spark of genuine interest lighting up her eyes.

Any resentment she harbored for Lu Zhen vanished, replaced by a genuine interest and care for her newfound kin. She no longer felt like a freak; it was as if she had finally met her own kind.

Xia Mei's mother had passed away when she was young, causing her to mature more quickly than other children her age. She had been a precocious child who discovered her unique powers early, understanding the potential trouble they could bring. Xia Mei had always kept her abilities hidden from others, fearing that they might uncover her secrets. Consequently, she spent her childhood living alone in her now-deserted mother's palace, with only a handful of servants to care for her. Lacking friends and any meaningful pursuits, she developed a deep fascination with martial arts, becoming a devoted practitioner from a young age.

Due to a stroke of luck and her unwavering dedication, she managed to join the Pink Autumn Sect. But this achievement came at a price ‚Äì her lack of social skills. She had never been good at interacting with others and had never really had friends. She used to dismiss the need for friendship as mere vanity, but deep down, she yearned for a companion who shared her unique abilities.

After all, this was human nature. Suppose when someone finds themselves in a foreign place without any familiar faces, they naturally feel more anxious about interacting with the locals. However, if they encounter another newcomer who is in the same situation, they often find it easier to connect and form a friendship. Lu Zhen, unaware of the emotions stirring within Xia Mei, glanced around his surroundings. Even if he were aware, he wouldn't care, as long as his secret remained hidden. If it were exposed, he would have to deal with her even if she is a woman.

[Bamboo (old)]

[Clay (old)]

[Remarks: trashes of trashest]

Looking at this row of details, all of which conveyed the same message, Lu Zhen was disappointed with himself.

"Looks like I need to level up my skill if I want it to be useful," Lu Zhen thought, hoping to find some seasoning for the meat, but his search yielded nothing.

Lu Zhen sighed and turned his attention to Xia Mei, his eyes focused on her.

[Xia Mei]

[Race: ???]

Lu Zhen remained disheartened, seeing all the question marks.

"How can I level up this appraisal skill?" wondered Lu Zhen, considering it was only his second time using it. "Maybe if I use it for an extended period, it will level up," he mused, a frown creasing his face. [You have used appraisal.]

[Your appraisal skill has levelled up from level 1 to level 2.]

As if on cue, a system prompt appeared, eliciting his excitement.

"I've never seen a skill level up this quickly," Lu Zhen thought, contemplating ways to exploit his appraisal skill and maximize its potential.

However, before he could delve deeper into his thoughts, his eyes, which had previously shone gold, reverted to their normal red hue. A slight dizziness washed over him.

"Huh," Lu Zhen thought, regaining his composure and footing.

"Why did my skill deactivate?" he pondered, checking his body. His eyes widened in shock. Nearly every trace of his qi had been drained.

"So, the skill consumes my qi, huh?" Lu Zhen concluded to himself.

Lu Zhen felt disappointed, as he had considered abusing this skill to level up his appraisal ability. However, knowing that it required qi to activate thwarted his plans. He had planned to endlessly maintain his appraisal skill and achieved infinite levelling if it didn't need qi to activate, rendering his strategy futile.

"Forget it," Lu Zhen thought bitterly as he placed the skewered meat over the fire to cook.

The initial contact produced a sizzling symphony of sounds ‚Äì the unmistakable hiss and crackle of protein meeting the searing heat. It was as if the fire itself whispered secrets to the meat, infusing it with primal energy.

Before his eyes, the meat gradually transformed as the relentless embrace of the flames bathed it in radiant warmth. The outer layers caramelized, forming a tantalizing crust that sealed in the meat's natural juices. Colors shifted from raw pink to a rich, golden brown, creating a visual masterpiece that mirrored the fiery canvas below.

With his unskilled movement Lu Zhen rotated the skewer. The sizzle intensified, sending aromatic tendrils of smoke spiraling upwards, leaving an indelible mark on the night air. You could almost taste the anticipation as the meat grew tender, its fibers surrendering to the relentless heat.

Finally, when the meat was cooked ‚Äì tender yet slightly charred, smoky yet succulent ‚Äì Lu Zhen pulled it away from the fire. The sizzling subsided, replaced by a little burnt smell.

[You have cooked.]

[You have acquired cooking skills.]

Lu Zhen became pleasantly surprised, although he wasn't perfect, at least the meat was edible.

"Looks like combat skills aren't the only ones I can gain; I could acquire some normal skills too," Lu Zhen thought as he skewered another batch of meat.

"Looks like I was right, not bad," Lu Zhen said to himself. Although the skill seemed simple, Lu Zhen believed that every skill was useful, and he had successfully tested his conjecture, so he was pretty happy with it.

Although he wasn't too optimistic about the skill, he was still happy to have it.

With that thought, Lu Zhen prepared another batch of skewered meat and cooked it up.

This time, Lu Zhen was even more skillful with the skewered meat, preparing it almost perfectly.

Stunning Lu Zhi, who was watching this ‚Äì after all, Lu Zhi was essentially a cook, although he primarily focused on wine, he still knew a thing or two about cooking. Seeing Lu Zhen, whose movements were so unrefined previously, become skilled so soon shocked him to the core.

[You have cooked.]

[Your cooking skill has levelled up from level 1 to 2.]

"Huh, just another batch of cooking has levelled up my cooking skills?" Lu Zhen thought to himself with some confusion.

"Looks like supporting or seemingly useless skills like this are pretty easy to level up," Lu Zhen thought with some excitement.

Once again, he prepared another batch of skewered meat, with his movements growing even more skillful.

[You have cooked.]

[Your cooking skill has levelled up from level 2 to 3.]

"This..." Lu Zhen was now flabbergasted, seeing that just one batch of cooking had allowed him to level up his cooking skill every time, and this was just skewered meat, which didn't even take much effort.

"Let's go on then, let's see how much I can level up," Lu Zhen thought as he finally found an exploit he could use, even if it might be the most useless one.

[You have cooked.]

[Your cooking skill has levelled up from level 3 to 4.]

[You have cooked.]

[Your cooking skill has levelled up from level 4 to 5.]

[You have cooked.]

[Your cooking skill has levelled up from level 5 to 6.]

[Your cooking skill has levelled up from level 8 to 9.]

[You have cooked.]

[Your cooking skill has levelled up from level 9 to 10.]

[Warning]

[Your cooking skill is evolving; you need more energy.]

A cold, emotionless voice entered his ears for the first time. However, the voice sounded a little like Lu Zhen himself, causing him to wake up from his reverie.

"What, my system has a voice too?" Ever since he got the system, he had never heard the voice of his system before. He was undoubtedly stunned when he saw that he could now hear the voice of the system.

However, seeing that the voice was quite cold and emotionless, as if it was pre-recorded, he felt a little relieved. Ignoring the fact that it was a little like Lu Zhen's own voice, he felt somewhat reassured.

After all, from the looks of it, his system wasn't alive and didn't possess any emotions, which alleviated some of the worries that Lu Zhen had about his system. It was better to have a dumb system than one with intelligence that could potentially betray him in the future.

42 Advancement

"So it is like that, huh‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen thought as he looked at his system warning for the first time.

[Warning: your energy is not enough to allow the host to advance this skill]

[Do you still want to continue <yes> or <no>]

A simple panel showed in front of Lu Zhen.

"Hmm..." Lu Zhen contemplated his chances but eventually chose "no."

Although he was a little tempted and curious about what this so-called cooking skill could do for him, he wasn't stupid; he knew the consequences of advancing right now. Since Lu Zhen had obtained the divine physique, he hadn't felt any exhaustion, and he was confident that his qi and body strength should be high. However, it wasn't enough that the system warned for the first time. From the looks of it, the requirements to advance the system skills were very high, and he didn't have a correct solution for it. What if he gets drained dry just by advancing this skill? So he decided to do it later.

Besides that, he stole a glance at Xia Long, who was just watching Lu Zhen cook with a smile on his face and even some concern. However, from his previous world experience, he knew these guys were the real ones who would stab you in the back at any moment ‚Äì pretentious individuals who were all shown. Although he might have believed him if he had seen this Xia Long for the first time, the malicious feeling he felt when Xia Mei came near him was undeniable. So this guy was undoubtedly an enemy of his. How could he be in a vulnerable state right in front of his enemy? So the best option was to find the most suitable moment.

That's why he wanted to kill this guy the very moment Lu Zhen saw this guy.

With that thought, Lu Zhen imagined pressing the "no" button, and the system prompt disappeared.

Lu Zhen was stunned.

"How will I advance the skill again?" Lu Zhen thought.

Lu Zhen hurriedly opened his system with a thought, feeling a little nervous and stupid.

"What if it was a one-time thing only?"

However, he was relieved when he saw the system panel.

Everything was all pretty normal except for the new skill he gained, which was already level 10.

[Cooking: level 10] (advance <yes><no>)

Seeing this, he was pretty relieved. He had thought that this advance thing was only for one time, but seeing the option still provided to him, his relief washed over him.

"Brother Lu, looks like the rain has stopped significantly. How about we go search for it now? We are very close to it," Xia Long said as he folded his fans into his two hands.

"Alright, Brother Xia, I will follow you," Lu Zhen said as he saw Xia Mei staring at him with sparks of interest.

He knew why she was like this; he had also seen her eyes when she came to check him out. They felt very similar to his own eyes but at the same time unfamiliar to him.

He knew that these eyes were obtained from that scroll, and she might be like him, possessing a bloodline. Although he didn't know all the details of the bloodline, he at least knew the basics that Yu Bai had given him.

Bloodline martial practitioners were able to comprehend different abilities from their ancestors if they were talented enough; apparently, Lu Zhen was also talented enough to gain bloodline abilities with a unique trait of his own.

However, Lu Zhen himself doubted his talent in anything, even with all the resources provided by the Lu family. These resources were enough to produce ten martial trainees; however, Lu Zhen's constitution was still at level 4, with almost no foundation to work on. So there was no possibility that he could be considered talented.

Therefore, the ability was most likely due to his system, as he received the notification from it. However, since the system registered it as his skill, did that mean the skill was his unique bloodline ability that he had gained, and was there any difference between his ability and the one other bloodline user possessed?

He didn't know and didn't contemplate any longer as it was useless to him now. It has become a habit of his to analyse everything even if it was useless.

"Sigh, only time will tell," Lu Zhen mused to himself, rising from his makeshift seat where he had prepared the skewered meat.

The scent of his skewered meat attracted his attention.

"Not bad, I really made this well," Lu Zhen thought as he examined the meat, which now had a pleasant smell.

When he took a bite of the meat, a tantalizing crunch gave way to succulent and tender meat beneath.

It was tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside, absolutely perfect. It filled Lu Zhen's mouth with joy.

"Let's go," Lu Zhen said as he got up and looked outside.

The plants and trees glistened under the soft, silvery shine of the waning moon, casting an ethereal glow over the surroundings. The rain had just stopped, leaving behind glistening raindrops on leaves and petals.

Sounds of insects humming their nocturnal melodies and the occasional calls of normal animals echoed through the tranquil forest however the roar and squeals of animals were heard from time to time as lu zhen could see blood from his superhuman eyes in the distance. However he decided to ignore these details for now.

The surroundings resembled a natural paradise. Unlike his previous world, where pollution had reached an all-time high, and he didn't venture outdoors much due to dedicating a significant portion of his life to learning coding, Lu Zhen now truly felt the beauty of nature at its finest. It refreshed his mind. Although ignoring the minor details.

"Has this bastard gone crazy since I have not met him for a month? He's cooking meat now?" Xia Long thought as he looked at the meat that Lu Zhen had grilled. It looked like the very definition of perfection, with an attention to detail that was truly impressive.

"You can grill all you want, but you will die soon anyways," Xia Long sneered in his mind as he looked at his cousin. Her eyes were still on Lu Zhen the whole time.

"I will punish her when she moans under me. That time she will regret even looking at the dead Lu Zhen by then," Xia Long thought as he narrowed his eyes.

However, maintaining his forced smile, which looked fake through and through.

"Let's go now, sister," Xia Long said with a smile on his face as he extended his hand.

However, Xia Mei didn't listen to him as she stayed where she was.

As Lu Zhen walked, Xia Mei also followed behind, looking like a hypnotized follower of Lu Zhen.

Observing this scene, Xia Long became even more infuriated, to the point where his face flushed crimson. However, he swiftly opened his fan to conceal his anger.

In the next moment, he made an effort to maintain a composed facade as he employed the fan to cool himself, pretending as if the heat was causing him some discomfort. However, his expression morphed into an unsettling blend of a forced smile and a frown, rendering his face to turn ugly.

"Sister, why don't you follow me? We're going the same way," Xia Long said, causing a frown to appear on Xia Mei's face.

"What does that have to do with you?" Xia Mei responded with a domineering tone.

Hearing this, Xia Long barely managed to control his anger. "Yes, sister," he said, bowing his head respectfully.

"Soon," Xia Long thought.

Hearing the interaction between the two, Lu Zhen was quite amused. He really liked this woman, Xia Mei.

With that said, Lu Zhen left the temple with Xia Mei following behind him, just staring at him, followed by the twins who were basically sidelined, and the two old men, Yu Bai and Xia Jiang, staying alert as they both kept a watchful eye on the surroundings and the opposite side.

As they exited the temple, none of them noticed an inconspicuous statue in a corner, its eyes subtly shifting as they moved farther away.

When they reached a certain distance, the statue made a creaking sound as it started cracking.

Creak! Creak!

Cracks started appearing in the statue as they shattered, revealing a tiny white ball that looked like a floating baseball. The white ball suddenly transformed from its round shape into a humanoid form about the size of a child, with white hair that resembled an ordinary child. However, its eyes were pitch black, which looked terrifying.

The child-like figure moved its mouth as if attempting to speak, but only the rustling of the wind filled the air. It silently observed the departing group until they disappeared into the distance.

After what seemed like an eternity of attempting to speak, the figure finally managed to utter a sentence.

"You are all going to die," the child said in a hoarse voice, which sounded too old for his child's body, as it followed them slowly.

43 Bloodline

"Urrrrrgh..." a deep, guttural sound resonated through the forest as the massive body of a bear collapsed. The bear looked utterly wretched, its form battered, bearing a conspicuous punch mark on its body, and bleeding profusely from multiple injuries.

With eyes full of terror, it began running, despite its massive 2200-pound body, moving with ferocious intensity as if its life depended on it, causing the ground to shake slightly.

Its eyes remained wide open, filled with disbelief at what had just occurred.

[Cyclone bear]

[Age: 30] [Normal beast] [Remark: a normal bear found in almost every forest; it could evolve into a great beast if it could evolve its bloodline to sense qi.]

Lu Zhen observed the system prompt detailing the bear's status as it disappeared into the distance. Since his appraisal eyes have levelled up, even though it was just a level, he could now see more information about any item when he needed it. However, he noticed that his qi was being drained faster than before, which left him somewhat puzzled. The new skill he had obtained, Appraisal eye, seemed to be the only one costing him qi, while others were passive and didn't appear to consume his energy.

Beasts had a ranking system similar to humans, with the distinction that they didn't need to cultivate like humans. Instead, they could naturally break through with time. They didn't require specific cultivation techniques; rather, the older they grew, the stronger they became, provided they had enough food.

However, this didn't mean they were stronger than humans. In fact, they were weaker due to their lack of intelligence in their early stages. They couldn't endlessly become stronger; they eventually reached their sealing limits and died due to age. This is why lower-ranked beasts were often hunted for resources. Humans, always curious, sought to use everything to their advantage.

The relentless growth of beasts, who primarily hunted and ate and just grew stronger from that, had made martial artists envious, leading to research on beasts.

One should not underestimate the power of science and research in this world. Although it lacked the unique technology of Lu Zhen's previous world, it had developed unique approaches. Even the most complex experiments, which would be challenging with modern technology, could be conducted with simple tools.

It was discovered that beasts possessed a bloodline that integrated into their bodies as they grew older. This piqued human curiosity about whether these bloodlines could also be applied to humans. After countless decades of research, it was found that humans could indeed have bloodlines. In fact, humans had a bloodline within them all along, but it was considered the weakest in the world, albeit the most flexible. It could evolve endlessly but required external assistance to do so.

They also found that other bloodlines could integrate into humans to make them stronger. That's where the Bloodline warriors were born. However, there were very few bloodline martial artists in this world because the method to integrate the bloodline into a human was a very complex process with a very low chance of success. It delved into the study of genes, and the success rate was so low that almost 99.99% of the people died during the transplant of their bloodline.

This transplant could only be taken by higher-ranking martial artists; otherwise, the failure rate was 100%. So almost none of the martial artists were willing to integrate the bloodline of a beast. After all, although they would gain powers beyond their stage, they had the chance of dying. So most of them gave up, except those who were stuck at their old age and had no hope of breaking through their limits. Only those people tried to integrate a bloodline, as it was their only hope.

In the history of the world, only eight people have been able to integrate their bloodline. At least that was what Lu Zhen knew. He didn't know if there were others, from what Lu Zhen had heard from Yu Bai, who came to be known as the ancestors. This ancestor's combat ability soared to new heights and they breakthrough and even their lifespan increased.

They shockingly discovered that their bloodline also transferred to their descendants. From that moment, the eight high-tier martial artists intercourse frequently to produce countless descendants, and they established the eight great clans which almost ruled the world in their era. But, unfortunately, time was an ethereal thing. The eight kings even with their bloodline to help eventually died.

Which led to the downfall of eight clans eventually due to a lack of talented descendants. The descendants didn't have a 100% chance of inheriting the bloodline. Even if they had the bloodline, some were just not talented enough to become martial artists, and their bloodline could only serve as external assistance.

That's why, with time, the eight families declined and were shattered ages ago. However, their descendant trail is still found till today. This was what Lu Zhen had heard from Yu Bai. He too was the descendant of a bloodline owner, but he didn't know which one. When he asked Yu Bai the question, he just kept silent, refraining from answering it.

"Brother Lu, you are truly impressive," Xia Long commented with a mocking tone on his face, sporting a smile, seeing that Lu Zhen couldn't defeat an ordinary beast and had let it escape.

"You can think whatever you want after you go to the grave," Lu Zhen thought with a sneer as he ignored Xia Long's mocking tone.

"So where are we going?" Lu Zhen said with an emotionless face.

"We will be arriving soon, Brother Lu. I am sorry if I offended you," Xia Long said in a sincere tone, as if he really didn't mean it, putting his hands at the back of his head.

Lu Zhen just sneered in his mind as they continued to walk.

Soon, they arrived at a big hill that looked just as average as all the hills surrounding it. When Lu Zhen looked up, he could see the hill ascend as if it didn't even have an end to it.

Xia Long stopped right there, putting his hand in front of his mouth and making a "shh" sound.

"This is where I found the delphinium, but unfortunately, there was a snake beast in the third stage of the martial realm guarding it. I couldn't take it out as I was alone at that time," Xia Long said with a smile still on his face, somehow recovering from the ugly expression he had made.

"I have heard that Brother Lu has reached the martial trainee level, and seeing that you could chase away an ordinary beast with just a punch, how about you go and deal with the snake for experience? We will come to help you right away if anything happens," Xia Long suggested with a meaningful smile, pointing outward to a place covered with leaves.

Hearing this, Lu Zhen felt oddly familiar. Didn't he just slay the snake in the third stage of the martial realm just before? If that was the case, then Xia Long was really digging a grave for himself.

"Alright, then, Brother Xia, I will go," Lu Zhen said with an emotionless face, although he was trying to hide his amusement internally. While he wanted to deal with these guys now, he didn't want any witnesses to escape. He was sure that Yu Bai could easily take care of Xia Jing if he went into the bloodline form, but there was still a possibility of escape they had, which he didn't like.

Lu Zhen had a life principle: "Strike only when prepared." He wasn't 100% sure that he could kill them all while capturing the woman, and he didn't want to take chances. So he was waiting for the right opportunity to strike, unless he was 100% sure he wouldn't strike, but he knew that this wasn't always applicable in the real world. Countless variables could come into play. What if a meteor fell from the sky or if someone heard the commotion and came to help? There were countless possibilities, even though they might be unlikely, but there was always an off chance of them becoming true.

With that thought, he said, "Alright, Brother Xia," as he headed toward the hills.

Xia Mei was stunned, hearing Lu Zhen being so agreeable to Xia Long, which left her confused.

"Am I wrong about him?" she thought to herself.

"Brother, you should go help Lu Zhen," Xia Mei said as she stopped Lu Zhen from leaving. However, hearing this, Xia Long tightened his fist as if he was going to say something. Yet, before he could speak, Lu Zhen interrupted him.

"Don't worry about it, Miss Xia. I'll be fine," Lu Zhen said in an uncaring manner as he went to the hill, stunning Xia Mei, who was trying to intervene. Although she felt that Lu Zhen was not simple, she didn't want to take any chances and potentially lose someone who might know her what her true identity.

44 Qi Crystal

The hill was rocky and appeared inconspicuous among the other hills. However, the moment Lu Zhen touched the leaves, they crumbled, revealing a vast cave. Lu Zhen had expected this, but he was still stunned by the size of the cave.

The cave was enormous, and Lu Zhen couldn't help but wonder how the snake managed to conceal its entrance with leaves.

Without looking back, Lu Zhen entered the cave.

"Lu Zhen should be safe if he is so confident in himself," Xia Mei thought as she watched Lu Zhen enter the cave.

"If something happens to him, you are dead," Xia Mei said domineeringly as she sat cross-legged.

Hearing this, Xia Long just smiled.

"Does this bitch think that she can give me a death warning? Our statuses are equal," Xia Long thought as he silently took out a bag.

After all, although the pink autumn sect was powerful she was just an inner disciple, technically his and Xia Mei status were the same.

He ate the pill hidden under his mouth and opened the bag; the moment it opened, an invisible substance began to spread.

Meanwhile Lu Zhen who entered the cave, was met with dim darkness, with a long passage that he could barely see due to the lack of light.

He could hear water drops falling to the ground and strange noises.

Although his diving physique had heightened his five senses, he still couldn't see in the darkness. Noticing this, Lu Zhen frowned.

"I will have to think of a better option for the future," Lu Zhen thought with a frown as he slowly walked along the passageway. Seeing in the darkness was a common skill among martial artists, but being new to the martial world, Lu Zhen hadn't learned many techniques yet.

The only techniques he had just begun to grasp were the [Verdant Whirlwind Slash] and the cultivation technique, the Verdant Saber Art. Apart from these, he hadn't acquired any other practical skills.

This was a problem Lu Zhen had just noticed. He didn't have the time to properly train combat arts right now, as he was getting distracted by various factors.

However, it wasn't without benefits. His skills had improved, and he had levelled up significantly compared to staying in seclusion and focusing solely on martial arts. From his perspective, remaining in seclusion was worse; depending on his talent, he couldn't train combat arts effectively.

Lu Zhen faced two choices: either remain secluded to learn more techniques while slowly leveling up, or level up rapidly with limited combat skills and rely primarily on his innate abilities for killing.

Of course, Lu Zhen chose both options. He wasn't one to reject benefits. When the time was right, he would engage in combat, and when it was peaceful, he would focus on seclusion. From what Lu Zhen had seen, the higher his level, the faster he could train, combat and cultivate, so choosing both options was the way to go.

Lu Zhen felt something plain and smooth on the ground and looked down, which stunned him.

The floor of the cave was actually made of marble, which surprised him. Lu Zhen crouched down to observe it and felt its smooth texture, causing him to frown.

"Huh, this looks like a man-made cave for sure; it doesn't look like a cave made by a snake," Lu Zhen thought with a frown, feeling confused.

"There must have been humans living in the cave before the snake made its den," Lu Zhen thought while rubbing his hands.

"Let's explore," Lu Zhen thought as he walked along the long passageway of the cave.

Since the snake had managed to hide here for so long, there must be a secret within that allowed it to remain concealed and grow stronger.

Thak! Thak!

Footsteps resounded in the cave as Lu Zhen made his way along the passageway. After a short two-minute journey, he noticed the passage was getting bigger, and there was faint light coming from the other end, which he could barely see as he walked quickly while staying alert to any danger. He saw a faint light in the distance, prompting him to run faster.

He also observed that the passageway was getting wider as he travelled. Finally, after five minutes of travel, he reached the light. What greeted his eyes was a place filled with crystals that glittered in the light.

Seeing this, Lu Zhen's eyes sparkled with greed upon reading the description of the crystals.

[Qi Crystal]

[Remark: An ore that has absorbed qi and been compressed in stone for so long that the qi became trapped in the stone, turning it into a qi stone. Can be used as currency.]

When Lu Zhen saw the description, he was undoubtedly surprised. Qi crystals were a very rare resource in this world, used by martial artists for trade and cultivation. Gold and other ordinary materials were useless to martial artists, so they used qi crystals as currency. Even if they didn't use them for trading, they could use them to aid in cultivation, as third-stage martial artists or higher could directly absorb the dense, attributeless qi through their qi pathways, greatly increasing their cultivation speed.

Lu Zhen, even as the heir of the Lu family, didn't get many qi crystals, only five per year, which was the same as the salary of an ordinary family elder. Seeing an entire mine of crystals was undoubtedly a cause for joy, even if the mine was relatively small, containing around 500 to 800 qi crystals based on his knowledge.

Lu Zhen, ignoring his happiness, looked around and found some snake-shedded skin on the floor next to a small pond.

[Shedded Skin of Gorgon Snake]

[Remarks: What more do you want?]

Seeing the status of the shedded skin of the gorgon snake, Lu Zhen knew that the snake Xia Long was talking about must be the gorgon snake he had just defeated. Thinking of this, Lu Zhen smirked a little.

"Pretentious bastard is going to die soon," Lu Zhen thought.

Lu Zhen undoubtedly found it amusing and was curious about who was writing these descriptions for him.

However, the way of speaking was a little too similar to the way Lu Zhen had trolled some newbies when he had accidentally modded his favorite game or when he had created a game that flopped and was abandoned before it even started.

Lu Zhen, ignoring his amusing thoughts, looked at the pool that was oozing a meager amount of qi.

[Qi Pool]

[Remark: The dense qi from the qi crystals made the surrounding qi so abundant that it formed in a liquid state. However, there are six eggs in the pond, which has caused the pool's qi to be less than it was supposed to be.]

Seeing this, Lu Zhen was a little angry.

"So, these little eggs‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen was about to continue, but he thought of something. He jumped into the pool and took the six eggs out to examine their status.

[Gorgon Egg]

[State: Fetus]

[Remarks: Stronger than other gorgon snakes]

Hearing the remarks, Lu Zhen almost threw the eggs in a fit of rage, but he restrained himself. It would be a waste to throw them away, so he held onto them.

Suddenly, he thought of something. Since Xia Long said that he had the flower, why hadn't Lu Zhen found it at all?

Lu Zhen found this strange.

He decided to go back but, before doing so, he looked at the mine one last time with a greedy look and then continued.

"I will come for you again, my treasure," Lu Zhen said as he reluctantly left the place, stashing the eggs in his pouch.

Lu Zhen carefully looked all the way back but didn't find a single trace of any flower as he retraced his steps.

"So he was lying, huh‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen thought.

"What is he planning to do?" Lu Zhen said as he returned. As he was returning, he sensed a fishy smell in the air. The moment he inhaled the air, he, who was perfectly fit, suddenly started feeling dizzy.

[You have been affected by poison.]

Lu Zhen's eyes began to shut as he tried to stay awake; however, he just couldn't even stand still. As he fell to the floor with his eyes half closed, the sudden pain from having his head hit the floor woke him up from his sleep.

[You have adapted to grinwar poison.]

[Your adapt skill has levelled up from level 2 to level 3]

Seeing the prompt lu zhen was terrified. Just taking a whiff almost knocked me out cold? Lu zhen thought with shock.

In this world, poison is pretty useless unless you want to kill a mortal or a martial trainee because, after one becomes a third-stage martial artist, they basically become immune to most of the poisons in this world. Even if there were poisons, they were expensive to make, as they needed countless resources to even be created, which could very well nurture a first-stage martial artist just to kill a third-stage martial artist, and there were countless methods to counter poisons, so poisons were rarely used in anything.

45 Muscle Aura

Lu Zhen slowly inhaled and exhaled the air as he walked forward.

[You have adapted to Grimgar poisons.]

[Your Adapt skill has levelled up from Level 3 to Level 4.]

Seeing the level-up prompt, Lu Zhen felt satisfied. However, nothing happened after the prompt. No matter how hard he inhaled the poison, he couldn't level up at all.

Lu Zhen frowned as he sensed that the poison no longer affected him in any way. Whenever he inhaled the poison, it felt like air to him, and his body showed no reaction, preventing him from leveling up.

"Looks like I can't level up at all with this poison now," Lu Zhen thought with some disappointment. He had thought that since the system prompt even showed the name of the poison, it was special. However, only levelling up his Adapt skill twice with it left him feeling a little disappointed.

"Weak poison, I thought it was special," Lu Zhen said, pausing for a second.

"Since I can't level up my Adapt skill, it would be useless to me now." Looking at the colourless poison in the air as if he could see the poison, Lu Zhen felt a little disappointed. However, he suddenly thought of a way to make use of this poison.

"Oh, Xia Long, you are going to die a miserable death today," Lu Zhen sneered. Although he didn't know who had caused this poison, his hunch told him it must have been Xia Long.

Lu Zhen took a deep breath, exhaling for a full two minutes before stopping. He felt that he had reached his limits.

In the dim cave, he glanced at his reflection, which was barely visible. His body appeared a bit weaker than before, but his muscles emanated a terrifying aura. His abs were defined pure muscle, and his slightly smaller biceps had a more profound and menacing shape. Even his legs were more muscular, though slightly deflated.

Lu Zhen found himself taken aback as he detected a significant change in his aura. It was a transformation he hadn't anticipated. Without a moment's hesitation, he decided to release it, wanting to understand the extent of this newfound power.

As he let his aura spill out, a dense and imposing atmosphere began to pervade the surroundings. Rocks in the cave started to emit eerie creaking sounds, as if they were bearing the weight of an immense force. The sensation coursing through him was unusual and exhilarating.

In particular, he noticed his deflated muscles responding to this release of aura. They seemed to resonate with it, pulsating with newfound strength. A pleasurable sensation washed over him, and he couldn't help but marvel at the transformation happening within him. His deflated muscles resonated with his aura.

Gradually, the creaking sounds echoed beneath Lu Zhen as rocks cracked due to the influence of his aura. He was amazed but promptly ceased releasing his aura, returning the surroundings to stillness.

"Could my aura have reached a level where it can materialize?" Lu Zhen contemplated this thought. Typically, one's aura could affect the surroundings only when they had reached the first rank of martial arts or an equivalent combat power level. Considering his strength, he doubted that he had reached the combat strength of a second-stage martial artist or higher. Comparing his aura to other martial artists, there was no indication of such a significant leap.

Lu Zhen speculated that it might be due to his deflated muscles causing his aura to behave unusually. However, he couldn't delve into this mystery at the moment. His body was barely holding on without any air, and while he supplemented it with his qi, it wasn't enough to sustain him.

Despite this, Lu Zhen refrained from inhaling. Instead, he opened his mouth and began vacuuming all the air and poison from his surroundings.

As he did so, his deflated body quickly returned to its original form. But he didn't stop there; he absorbed all the air and poison like a black hole.

With every breath, his metabolism worked wonders, converting the poison into qi, which his body absorbed. His qi storage gradually increased, and his body expanded from the influx of air. His muscles grew slightly, though there were no significant changes.

The qi strengthened his body, while the energy nurtured it. After a considerable time, almost all the poison had been absorbed, and his body had reached a towering height of 15 feet. He then exhaled all the air he had taken in, returning to his normal state.

[You have consumed poison.]

[Gluttony skill has leveled up from level 5 to level 6.]

Seeing the prompt, Lu Zhen had successfully tested his conjecture.

"Looks like the Gluttony skill only increases my metabolism to an insane level, allowing me to eat anything I want with it," Lu Zhen thought with satisfaction. However, he now knew that the skill wasn't too heaven-defying, as he wasn't immune to anything outside his stomach. It only affected his metabolism, and there should be a limit to his gluttony too. If there was no limitation lu zhen could very well be invincible.

"I will grant you an excruciating death for helping me test my skills, Xia Long," Lu Zhen sneered to himself as he quickly made his way out of the cave as his footstep quickened.

Meanwhile, Xia Long's face contorted with disbelief as he stood outside the cave, his senses tingling with an odd sensation. He could clearly perceive that all the poison in the air was being sucked dry by something within the cave. Despite the poison being colourless, Xia Long wasn't stupid to not even have a technique to sense the poison. Especially after going through so much trouble to just get the poison.

And the fact that every trace of poison was vanishing into the cave's depths, as if it were a bottomless void, filled him with an overwhelming sense of disbelief. He couldn't comprehend how this was happening, and his mind raced to make sense of the impossible.

Chapter 46 Xia Long Plans

Xia Long looked around as he spotted the bodies of the five people, all of whom were unconscious. Actually, the poison wasn't harmful; it was just designed to make the martial artists sleep. He had concocted it using almost all the resources he had received from his mother. He had always wanted to teach his bratty cousin, who had rejected his advances and become a disciple of the Pind Autumn Sect. After she joined the sect, he knew he had almost no chance of touching her. However, the sight of his cousin's body had driven him to become horny again as she had a beauty that xiao long just couldn't resist anymore when she again visited the family in the previous winter. His desire has driven him to spend all the resources his mother had given him on concocting a poison that could even affect third-stage martial artists by finding a poison master and making a deal with him he was so horny that he even negelating martial arts.

When he heard that his cousin was searching for a flower, Xia Long finally knew that his chance had come. So he fabricated a story to trick her. After all, he wasn't stupid.

If she had truly become a core disciple of the sect, he would have been at her mercy for the rest of his life. But as she was only an inner disciple for now, he could still escape that fate by convincing his mother and her associates.

So, he had created a poison to incapacitate her temporarily, planning to savour her beauty before killing her and eliminating this threat once and for all.

As he contemplated this, his treacherous little brother, barely more than a worm, stirred, growing slightly larger.

As for the cave, he had discovered it by chance, but he fabricated the story. He wanted to explore the cave himself, but he refrained because he had seen a snake guarding it, one that could rival a third-stage martial artist. He had no intention of sharing such a valuable find with anyone. He kept it a secret because if word got out about a third-stage beast in the forest, martial artists would come rushing to claim the resource. As for Lu Zhen and the others, he sought revenge for their thwarted plans involving the assassin his mother had specifically instructed him to send after the Jiang family's young miss. Although he was reluctant to part with such a beauty, he bore with it and dispatched the assassin, fully aware of how terrifying his mother could be. He had the plan to obtain xia mei so he didn't care about the other beauty.

Moreover, he had a chance to earn some contribution. However, when he saw that everything had gone awry because of Lu Zhen, he was undoubtedly infuriated. In fact, he was grounded by his mother for a week as a result of this failure.

However, as he looked at the nearly finished poison, he felt a growing unease. Even though the poison was effective, it had a time limit. He couldn't underestimate third-stage martial artists; they could awaken at any moment.

He had no knowledge of what was happening in the cave, but given the strangeness of the situation, Lu Zhen should have died by now. A martial trainee like him couldn't have survived such a concentrated dose of poison. If, by some chance, Lu Zhen had survived, he would have been unconscious for weeks at least he thought he had died. With determination in his eyes, he approached Xia Jiang and, without a hint of pity, slit his throat using the sword at his waist. Although it felt like cutting through metal, he managed to do it with the help of his combat art.

"Wind slash."

Yet, he still wasn't satisfied. Although blood gushed profusely, he had to be cautious. Third-stage martial artists and above could recover from mortal wounds in seconds if they had the necessary qi. With a cold expression, he severed the neck of his former servant, Xia Jiang, who had cared for him since childhood.

With a sickening sound, Xia Jiang's head was decapitated, but Xia Long continued to strike until Xia Jiang was mutilated in his sleep.

"Old Jiang, you will be remembered," Xia Long thought, fake tears in his eyes. Although he would lose a trusted third-stage martial artist, it was better than leaving any witnesses who might uncover his crimes and lead to his downfall. Even his mother's forces might abandon him in such a scenario.

Unbeknownst to him, at the cave entrance, Lu Zhen stared at him, thinking, "What an idiot." He sneered as he watched Xia Long kill Xia Jiang, the only one who had a slim chance of protecting him.

However, Lu Zhen was somewhat puzzled by Xia Long's extreme actions. True, he had made Xia Long look like a fool and had ignored him, but it shouldn't warrant such a drastic response.

"These shouldn't be the reasons why..." Lu Zhen pondered as he observed the situation.

Regarding why Xia Long hadn't killed Old Bai first, Lu Zhen had a theory. Perhaps it was because Yu Bai had always been known as a sick, frail old man, seemingly on the brink of death. In the public eye, he had barely entered the third stage of martial arts. From Xia Long's perspective, eliminating his own follower first was undoubtedly the wisest choice, considering his determination to leave no witnesses.

"The moment Xia Long touches any of my followers, his fate is sealed," Lu Zhen thought as he carefully observed Xia Long, as if watching a great display of "how to be foolish."

"Wait, could it be..." Lu Zhen contemplated as he noticed a pathetic little worm standing up in Xia Long's crotch area. Upon this realization, Lu Zhen was disgusted, yet his eyes widened as he considered his conjecture.

He looked at Xia Mei and then back at Xia Long.

"So that's it, huh?" Lu Zhen thought, disgust evident in his eyes.

Chapter 47 White Haired Girl

Lu Zhen's expression twisted into one of pure disdain as he watched Xia Long's antics.

"Weakling," Lu Zhen's only word was that. Seeing Xia Long go through so much trouble just to lay with Xia Mei, Lu Zhen felt pure disgust. However, at least he was smart, seeing how he had planned everything so seamlessly. If Lu Zhen had not been around, Xia Long's plan might succeed, but that is an "if," and this has not happened since he was here.

Lu Zhen had always been a firm believer in the power of strength. In his view, strength could make everything fall into place, like gifts. That's why he had focused on his career before anything else, knowing that as long as he achieved success, he could attract any woman he desired with just a little effort. However, after his transmigration, he became a bit arrogant and decided to try something new by pursuing a girl. It turned out to be a disastrous endeavour, and things could have been even worse if he didn't have the strength to protect himself.

However, he never forgot his true pursuit: strength. He believed that as long as he continued on the path of strength, everything else would eventually fall into place. This had been his belief in the past, and it remained true for him now. He couldn't predict the future, but as long as he was Lu Zhen, he would never stray from the pursuit of strength.

Lu Zhen sneered as he was about to make a move but suddenly heard a voice transmission.

"Young master, should I kill him now?" Lu Zhen heard the voice of Yu Bai in his head.

Lu Zhen's eyes widened as he saw Yu Bai sleeping.

"Young master, I was awake previously. Our bloodline gives us better resistance to poison. Although it affected me a little, it didn't make me go to sleep." Lu Zhen heard this word, and he felt it was understandable. From the first time Lu Zhen had seen the form of Yu Bai, he was 50% sure that he could defeat some ordinary second-stage martial artist. So it shouldn't have affected Yu Bai as much.

"Let's kill him now," Lu Zhen sent a voice transmission to Yu Bai, as there was nothing to watch now.

Xia Long, who was still not aware of his doom, was going towards Yu Bai.

Lu Zhen was about to speed off to kill Xia Long in one strike; however, he felt something that sent shivers down his spine as his instinct acted up warning him about something he looked left and right but he couldn't find anything making him confused.

The moment he was looking for the danger that his senses tingle with danger he suddenly felt an icy-cold hand rest on his shoulder, and a sudden chill swept over him. It was a sensation he couldn't ignore.

"Brother, brother, can you please give me some candy?" The voice was childlike, innocent, and carefree, echoing in Lu Zhen's ears. However, Lu Zhen frowned upon hearing the voice.

The moment he turned around, he saw a little girl with a white kimono on her body with white hair. With an innocent smile that a child has, she was smiling.

The kimono was a little ragged, and the girl was a little dirty, but she appeared quite clean. She was holding a bag in her hand which was ragged and torn.

However, the moment Lu Zhen saw the girl's eyes, his frown deepened. The girl's eyes were pitch black. As Lu Zhen attempted to maintain eye contact, he began to feel a bit dizzy and overwhelmed. It was almost as if the girl's pitch-black eyes were trying to invade his mind, hypnotizing him and making him feel drowsy.

However, ignoring the feeling, Lu Zhen remained silent as he just stared at the girl for a moment, and his frown intensified.

"Big brother, please give me some candy," the child said again as she extended a bag which she was holding with lots of candy.

Lu Zhen remained emotionless as he stared at her.

"Oh so you want some candy."

In an instant, Lu Zhen sneered and, without a second thought, swung a punch at the girl's face.

Lu Zhen was expecting some resistance; however, the punch cleanly connected with the girl's face in a second as she was sent flying.

Her body, like a ragged doll, was sent flying to the walls of the cave.

A dong sound resounded as the girl crashed into the wall.

Lu Zhen was quite shocked seeing this as he looked at his hands. He had full-powered punch the girl, but it felt like he was hitting the air, as his punch couldn't connect properly for some reason. This was barely 1% of his power; if it was 100%, the girl would have burst like a balloon.

However, that was not the reason he was shocked. The reason he was shocked was that the girl felt normal to him, like an ordinary girl, except for the damage reduction. Lu Zhen felt that the girl was totally ordinary.

He wasn't stupid; there was no way an ordinary person can sneak up behind him without him even noticing, even as he was on high alert, and his five senses were superhuman. There was no absolute way that anyone could sneak up on him, and she was a little girl no less. So without a shred of hesitation, Lu Zhen punched the girl in the face.

"So what is this girl about?" Lu Zhen thought as he tried to search in his memories for a phenomenon which was quite similar to it. However, he couldn't find anything similar.

At a loss, Lu Zhen simply gave up.

"Oh well, she is dead anyway," Lu Zhen said as he was again going to attack Xia Long. However, suddenly his vision blurred for a second before he could even comprehend the situation. He once again saw the girl in front of him, still there with the same get-up.

"Big brother, can you give me some candy?" the girl said again in her same voice as previously.

48 Punch

Lu Zhen narrowed his eyes to thin slits as he witnessed the girl's miraculous recovery, baffled by her apparent resilience to his attack. She appeared completely unharmed, as if nothing had happened, and repeated her request for candy as if on a loop.

"Big brother, can you give me some candy?" The girl's words sounded almost mechanical in their repetition.

Lu Zhen stood there, his mind racing as he contemplated the bizarre situation. "Since she can somehow revert back to normal and even temporarily blur my vision as she recovers..." Lu Zhen sneered, his voice dripping with skepticism as he voiced his thoughts aloud.

"Lets see how many times you can take this," Lu Zhen challenged as he unleashed another punch at the girl.

The girl, like a ragdoll, was sent flying once more, and as expected, his vision blurred momentarily, only for the girl to reappear in her unharmed state.

"I can keep this up all day, but can you?" Lu Zhen taunted the unseen entity as he continued his relentless assault.

"Three‚Ä¶ hundred‚Ä¶ two hundred ... Three hundred..." Lu Zhen counted the strikes, his brow furrowing with determination.

"I can keep going like this forever," Lu Zhen said loudly as his blood began to boil.

Although he could feel something sapping his physical strength away, he didn't care since the stamina drain was pitiful. With Lu Zhen's divine physique, he could recover faster than the absorption rate. He pummelling the creature with punch after punch.

"Four hundred," Lu Zhen shouted loudly as he punched the creature again. However, this time, he began to notice visible nervousness on the girl's face as she reappeared. Although she still wore a kind smile, her face was glistening with sweat against her cold white complexion.

In reality, Lu Zhen was growing mentally tired of this relentless battle because he also had to restrain his demonic form, which could go out of control at any moment. Seeing the girl's unwavering persistence was driving him to the brink of insanity.

Despite the constant struggle to keep his demonic urges in check, Lu Zhen continued punching even faster.

"Five hundred," Lu Zhen punched the girl one hundred more times. Finally, the girl began to break down, melting into the darkness and disappearing from the cave as if she had never existed.

As she disappeared, her mouth moved, though no sound emerged. In the dimness, Lu Zhen strained to decipher her silent message. His eyes widened as he interpreted her final words, a mixture of anger and humiliation swelling within him.

Unbeknownst to him, a strange butterfly-shaped mark materialised seemingly out of thin air. It clung to his skin like a persistent insect, its presence concealed as it silently syphoned away his strength, like a parasite it slowly started draining Lu Zhen's strength.

"You're lucky... until next time," Lu Zhen repeated those words to himself, mimicking the subtle mouth movements of the girl just before she disappeared into the darkness. As he deciphered her silent message, he felt a little irritated for being looked down upon. It gnawed at his pride, leaving a lingering sense of annoyance and determination in its wake.

"Next time, you're definitely going to meet your end, whoever you are," Lu Zhen declared with a cold and determined tone. His eyes radiated a chilling resolve, as if he had already pronounced a death sentence upon the mysterious creature.

Lu Zhen's mood had soured considerably. Even creatures as insignificant as cats and dogs had dared to challenge him, and it deeply irritated him. Despite having a gut feeling that the entity had not revealed her full power, he remained unfazed. In his mind, he held unwavering confidence, for he, too, had concealed his true potential. With numerous skills and the untapped might of his bloodline, he possessed an arsenal of power. If all else failed, he was convinced he could consume her entirely, absorbing her strength and erasing her existence. After all, Lu Zhen, who had considered gluttony the weakest skill previously, had actually discovered that it was the one of the most powerful skills he possessed up to till this point.

Moreover, since the creature had fled while mocking him, it was even more beneficial for Lu Zhen. He believed he would become even stronger than it in the future. With the system in hand, Lu Zhen felt it was easy to gain more power, and at that point, he could confront and defeat the girl or whatever it was. Despite his irritation, he decided not to chase after the fleeing creature.

Even if he wanted to chase, he couldn't find any traces of where she had gone.

"You won't get away next time," Lu Zhen said with a sneer as he thought of that.

However, this irritating feeling was still bothering him.

"I need to vent on something," Lu Zhen thought as he searched for a way to release his pent-up frustration. Although he could almost perfectly suppress this feeling with the Adapt skill, it was still annoying to have.

Lu Zhen looked at Xia Long as he was about to strike Yu Bai, which made Lu Zhen light up with excitement as he found the perfect target, soon to be dead in his eyes.

Although the fight, or Lu Zhen punching the creature as a sandbag, might have seemed to take a long time, it really didn't take that long. Lu Zhen could strike about 50 punches per second, so it took only about 10 seconds, which was just enough time for Xia Long to reach Yu Bai.

"Die," Lu Zhen said aloud as he moved with the speed of a cheetah, catching up to Xia Long in seconds.

Meanwhile, Xia Long, gleefully fantasizing about having fun with his sister, was just about to strike Yu Bai. Seeing Xia Long's expression, even Yu Bai felt one thing.

"Idiot," Yu Bai thought as he prepared to make a move. His young master still hadn't arrived, which left him quite worried about Lu Zhen. After all, Lu Zhen had finally awakened his bloodline. Without delay, Yu Bai was about to kill Xia Long on the spot, but before he could even move, Lu Zhen came in a flash and kicked Xia Long, causing him to fall to the ground.

Meanwhile, the girl seemed to move with the wind as she ran. Her movements appeared almost like teleportation as she travelled, leaving afterimages of herself. With each step, she raised one leg, and the next moment, she would reappear in the distance.

The expression on her face remained cold and emotionless, like a porcelain doll. But despite her stoic exterior, her body told a different story. Beads of sweat clung to her skin, trickling down her brow and glistening like tiny diamonds under the sunlight.

Finally, she arrived back at the old, crumbling bamboo and clay temple. The moment she returned, she collapsed onto the cold, hard temple floor.

Her face turned visibly pale, and her body showed signs of being drained. Yet, after some time, she somehow managed to gather her strength and stand up.

However, As if like a miracle her body started being healed little by Little and her pale face regained her cold white colour and her body started to become nourished again.

"Finally, the mark has taken effect," the girl thought to herself as she located the corner where the statue's broken parts lay.

She closed her eyes as she sensed her surroundings.

"Looks like there is nobody," she thought to herself as she felt a bit of relief.

With a little effort, she walked towards it and pressed a stone that was slightly sticking out of the floor.

The moment she pressed the stone, a cracking sound echoed as a small entrance opened in the dilapidated temple.

Without hesitation, she jumped into the hole.

Her eyes were filled with darkness as she dived down into the hole. However, she didn't seem to care much as she remained upright, defying gravity with her head held high.

She fell for a good 3 to 5 minutes before finally, dim light appeared in the corner of her eyes.

Finally, she landed with a resounding "dong" sound on a metallic floor.

The moment she landed, she immediately bowed and said, "I greet master."

In the dimly lit room, everything appeared to be metallic, and it had a somewhat futuristic vibe. There were devices that resembled mobile phones on the walls, and some comfortable-looking sofas. There were some neatly arranged shelves.

If Lu Zhen had seen this, he would undoubtedly be shocked because the room gave off a modern vibe rather than the ancient world Lu Zhen thought it was.

Contrasting with the modern room was a single, huge icebox stored in a glass case, resembling a coffin.

"Why have you come, Ju Ji?" a cold voice rang out. The gender of the voice was unclear, but it held an eerie quality, as if the person had just awoken.

"Master, I have found a person with a physique similar to the ancient warriors," Ju Ji replied.

The room suddenly fell silent for a moment, filled with a chilling aura. However, breaking the stillness, a faint laughter was heard, and the room seemed to brim with life again.

"Finally, where is it?" the voice inquired once more, this time seemingly coming from all directions.

However, upon hearing this, Ju Ji trembled, her nervousness evident through her sweating and silence.

In response to her silence, the voice continued, "So you haven't brought him," with a hint of disappointment in its tone.

"Yes, master. I have lost too much energy, but I have marked him," Ju Ji said with anxiety.

Hearing this, the voice sounded a bit relieved, albeit still somewhat disappointed. "Give it to me."

"Yes, master," Ju Ji replied as she produced a golden ring with a metallic shine from seemingly nowhere and threw it toward the glass covering the grave.

The ring, made of pure gold with a mark resembling the one on Lu Zhen's, smoothly passed through the glass and into the ice.

"Finally, I have found a suitable body," the voice resonated with joy, but before it could revel any longer, a cracking sound echoed throughout the room, and the ring shattered, sending fragments scattering.

"This‚Ä¶" the voice uttered with disbelief, as if it couldn't believe its own senses.

The coffin-like structure expelled the broken ring as if it were vomiting as it landed in ji ju's hand.

"Who can do this?" the voice erupted with anger, accompanied by an incredulous tone.

After a moment of contemplation, it resumed, but this time with its emotionless coldness, "Take my bird and give it to that person."

A mechanical bird, resembling the one from earlier, flew to the girl's shoulder.

"Yes, master," Ju Ji replied with a happy bow however seeing the broken ring she was shocked to the core.

"A person who can escape the mark... interesting," a feminine voice echoed within the ice-like coffin, its human skin wrapped around a skeletal body smirking with amusement.

16:34

"We mages will rise again," the voice proclaimed with arrogance and a stubborn resolve.

"Now, leave," the voice commanded once more, and the room descended into silence again.

Ju Ji transformed into a white ball and ascended, exiting through the hole she had previously entered.

"A person who can escape the mark... interesting," a feminine voice echoed within the ice-like coffin, its human skin wrapped around a skeletal body smirking with amusement.

"We mages will rise again," the voice proclaimed with arrogance and a stubborn resolve.

Meanwhile, Lu Zhen continued to torment Xia Long.

"How interesting to find you here, Xia Long," Lu Zhen remarked, a smirk playing on his lips as he observed Xia Long lying on the ground.

"You‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶" Xia Long stammered, his eyes wide with disbelief, unable to comprehend what he was witnessing.

"How can you be fine?" Xia Long exclaimed loudly, his shock palpable.

Lu Zhen remained silent, gazing at Xia Long with an amused expression.

Gradually, Xia Long's frantic gaze shifted to his surroundings, and a realization seemed to dawn upon him. His eyes regained clarity.

"So, that's it, huh‚Ä¶" Xia Long muttered as understanding washed over him, followed by a bout of laughter.

He opened his mouth, as if about to speak, but no words escaped.

Suddenly, Xia Long sprang to his feet and launched an attack at Lu Zhen, swinging his sword in a swift, rightward motion. The motion created a gust of wind as Xia Long channeled his full power.

"Wind slash."

However, Lu Zhen, upon seeing the attack, felt a tinge of disappointment.

"Wind attribute, huh," Lu Zhen thought, sensing the faint qi surrounding Xia Long as he executed his slash.

"Let's get this over with."

50 Kidnap?

Lu Zhen was bored of toying with Xia Long, and he decided to put an end to their encounter. He raised his hand and executed a slashing motion. The mere movement of his hand triggered a powerful force that mimicked the swing of a saber swing as if lu zhen had really swung a saber.

With a mocking tone, Lu Zhen taunted Xia Long, "This is what is called a wind slash."

In this world, combat arts were essentially a fusion of physics and superhuman abilities. If one possessed enough raw strength, they could replicate the techniques of combat arts without the need for formal training in those arts.

Lu Zhen, despite lacking knowledge of combat arts similar to Xia Long's, could rely on his immense strength to produce similar moves. Although the efficiency of this conversion was highly unequal and could be considered trash even, Lu Zhen's sheer power advantage over Xia Long was staggering. When compared, the wind-qi-enhanced combat art that Xia Long employed seemed feeble next to the raw strength Lu Zhen could produce by just applying his saber mastery to his skill.

Xia Long's eyes widened in horror as he witnessed the colossal wind slash bearing down on him. It appeared as though a domineering saber strike was homing in on him. The wind current generated by Lu Zhen's attack surpassed Xia Long's own by at least tenfold.

As expected, Xia Long was filled with dread, and his eyes portrayed his terror. He could only helplessly watch as the wind slash he had unleashed was obliterated, while Lu Zhen's attack continued its inexorable trajectory. Xia Long desperately sought an escape route, but an overwhelming pressure placed him in place. His body became almost immovable, and he found himself incapable of lifting even a finger.

The approaching slash rapidly closed the distance, and in his final moments, tears and mucus mingled on his terrified face.

"I don't want to die..." were Xia Long's last thoughts as Lu Zhen's merciless attack cleaved his body into two.

Xia Long's body, cleaved in two by Lu Zhen's merciless attack, presented a gruesome and horrifying sight. The slash had torn through his flesh, muscles, and bones with incredible force, leaving behind a gruesome scene.

At the point of impact, there was a jagged, gaping wound where his body was severed, with torn and shredded tissue around the edges. Blood, still warm and vibrant, sprayed out from the wound in all directions, forming a crimson arc around the point of impact. The viscera and internal organs within his abdomen were exposed and torn apart.

The two halves of Xia Long's body were disconnected, with each side lying lifelessly on the ground. His limbs splayed out in unnatural positions. His life force rapidly faded as blood continued to pour from the grievous wound, staining the grassy land beneath him a dark, crimson red.

His lifeless eyes lost their lustre, staring vacantly into the abyss.

Seeing Xia Long die so quickly, although it might seem like Xia Long was as weak as a chicken, which he was, and Lu Zhen was bullying a Level 10 villain while he was at Level 100, which was exactly what he was doing, it may seem useless. But at least Lu Zhen got to test his new aura after it resonated with his muscles. So, Lu Zhen was a pretty happy camper.

Of course, Lu Zhen would prefer facing opponents weaker than him at every turn. Slaughtering his way to the top sounded like an efficient path to power. However, he knew that not everyone would be as recklessly self-destructive as Xia Long, who was essentially courting death.

With this in mind, Lu Zhen began contemplating strategies for dealing with the more formidable adversaries he would inevitably face in the future, all with the goal of levelling up faster.

"Let's go now," Lu Zhen said as he looked at the three people who were still fast asleep with a hint of bitterness.

"What should I do with her?" Lu Zhen pondered with some trouble. Now he was facing a dilemma with this girl.

He couldn't simply let her go. Killing her was out of the question because, regardless of the circumstances, he had ended her cousin's life.

Although Xia Mei might choose to keep this incident to herself, it was likely that she would still need to explain Xia Long's death. Lu Zhen was reluctant to leave any potential evidence behind that could lead to unforeseen trouble he didn't ask for.

The Xia family, like the Lu family, was one of the major families, and they would likely employ their full resources to avenge their young master if they discovered what happened. They wouldn't hesitate to confront the Lu family, as not taking action would be a matter of losing face. And a matter of losing face means that they might start to decline.

While Lu Zhen wasn't afraid of them, he considered the possibility of them sending their ancestor, a first-rank martial artist, after him if they somehow became brain dead. In such a scenario, his life would be in danger because although the Lu family also had a first-rank martial artist, accidents could happen, and he didn't want to live in fear. Therefore, it was crucial not to be discovered.

And it wasn't pleasant for Lu Zhen to leave such evidence, even if he wasn't discovered. How could he trust someone he had just met, even if she was a beauty? It didn't mean anything to him if she didn't have real value.

After all, the world was vast, and there were countless beauties among them.

However, there was a problem: he couldn't kill her. Unlike the lustful Xia Long, who had failed to recognize the biggest loophole, Lu Zhen understood that killing her would inevitably leave traces, no matter how meticulous he was. From what he remembered, Inner disciples were still valued in any sect, and they received teachings from at least second-stage martial artists. The sect was sure to investigate if one of its disciples went missing, especially if it involved an inner disciple. The Pink Autumn Sect was even larger than the Lu family, and Lu Zhen had no desire to invite further trouble.

Lu Zhen knew that until he became a first-class martial artist, he had to act cautiously. Only then could he act without hesitation.

Pondering his options, Lu Zhen frowned, realizing that there was no easy solution to this troublesome matter.

"Women really bring me trouble," Lu Zhen mused bitterly.

After contemplating for some time, Lu Zhen finally had a simple idea of what to do.

"Let's kidnap her," Lu Zhen decided. It wasn't an ideal solution, but it seemed to be the best option available.

Without hesitation, he instructed Yu Bai as he pointed at Xia Mei, "Old Bai, go gather a rope and some large leaves, about the size of her."

Hearing this, Yu Bai was taken aback and asked, "Young Master, do you mean..."

Lu Zhen simply nodded, and Yu Bai left to procure the items Lu Zhen needed with hints of reluctancy.

Swish!

With a swishing sound, Yu Bai disappeared from his spot as he went in search of it.

The moment Yu Bai left, Lu Zhen examined the mark that was printed on the back of his hand.

The mark resembled that of a butterfly and was pitch black in color, although not as dark as the girl's eyes, which seemed to be impenetrable to light. Somehow, she had marked Lu Zhen with this butterfly mark.

The colour of the mark was an intense black, and it bore a simple butterfly design, resembling a tattoo, albeit entirely black.

As Lu Zhen observed the tattoo, he inexplicably felt slight movements, as if the butterfly were alive, though it appeared to be devoid of vitality.

A thin, thread-like aura was connected to the tattoo. However, this connection was obstructed by Lu Zhen's own aura, creating a domain-like barrier. Lu Zhen continued to supply his aura to the tattoo, which seemed to consume it like a voracious black hole.

The tattoo was slowly sapping his strength away, although it was even more meagre than when Lu Zhen fought with the girl. It was subtle, barely noticeable with Lu Zhen's divine physique. This subtle drain of strength sent a shiver down his spine, but a peculiar smile still played on his face.

"How interesting, huh," Lu Zhen mused aloud. He ceased supplying his aura to the mark. As he did, the tattoo began to fade, almost as if it were dying. However, Lu Zhen quickly resumed supplying his aura to the tattoo, and in an instant, it regained its vibrant, almost revitalized appearance.

"This connection," Lu Zhen thought, his brows furrowing as he examined the long thread, its pitch-black colour pointing toward the direction that they were previously in the old temple. Pondering this, his frown deepened.

"Did I miss something in the temple?" Lu Zhen thought as he had examined nearly half of the temple's contents with his appraisal eyes. However, Lu Zhen felt it was natural to miss such a thing, considering that the girl had approached him from behind without him even noticing her presence. There must be something which he doesn't know about that allows such a phenomenon for them to do so.

Thinking of this Lu Zhen tightened his fist he still has a lot to learn.

In reality, during his battle with the girl, Lu Zhen hadn't even noticed that he had been marked by something peculiar. However, after the fight, he began to sense a strange aura slowly sapping his strength. Fortunately, his mastery of the aura control skill allowed him to detect such changes in his aura effortlessly. With this skill, he promptly isolated the tattoo by cocooning it within his own aura, preventing its insidious influence.

With his aura control skill levelled up so high, he could now change his aura into different forms.

"Let's sever this connection," Lu Zhen thought, as he had an idea about how to remove the pesky thread's connection.

After all, he was still interested in this butterfly tattoo and wanted to unravel its mystery. He had never heard of such a heaven-defying thing that could sap an enemy's physical strength. If he could harness this power, he could potentially exhaust enemies to death without even lifting a finger.

"Let's do this," Lu Zhen thought as he slowly closed his crimson eyes.

As Lu Zhen closed his eyes, he began to visualize a saber. He tried to shape a small portion of his aura accordingly.

Slowly, an invisible force materialized in Lu Zhen's hand, forming into the semblance of a handle.

However, Lu Zhen began to sweat after the handle was constructed. It felt challenging to create, but he didn't give up; he persisted.

Gradually, a blade began to grow from the handle. But this time, when the blade was halfway formed, a cracking sound echoed in the surroundings.

Creak!

With a creaking sound, the aura in the shape of a saber collapsed, causing Lu Zhen to feel dizzy.

"Sigh, my aura control skill isn't sufficient," Lu Zhen thought with bitterness. He had no choice but to continue. Although his aura control skill could shape into various forms, it couldn't replicate the physics of a saber accurately, as neither his aura control nor his saber mastery skills were advanced enough to imprint his aura with the characteristics of a saber.

Thinking this through, Lu Zhen decided to opt for an easier approach.

He closed his eyes once again, visualizing a saber. However, this time, the saber was peculiar; it lacked a handle, consisting only of the blade with one side sharp and the other flat.

Gradually, a small portion of Lu Zhen's aura separated from him, materializing into the shape of a blade. Lu Zhen meticulously imagined the blade's form, height, length, weight, temperature, and nearly all its attributes. The aura gradually took on the blade's unusual shape.

Yet, when Lu Zhen sensed the final form of the blade, he was nearly repulsed. The saber blade he had envisioned had turned into something resembling a blender blade, almost taking on the form of a snake. Its blade tip was sharp on both sides, although the sharpness seemed barely enough to cut through paper, let alone harm a person.

Suppressing his disappointment, Lu Zhen had to give it a try. He thought, "Will this blade even work?" as he swung the invisible aura blade at the string.

The moment the blade sliced through the string, like a sharp knife cutting through paper, it effortlessly severed the string into two pieces, leaving Lu Zhen stunned.

Meanwhile, Ji Ju, who was sprinting at top speed while carrying the remnants of the ring, noticed that the broken ring parts all turned to dust as they were carried away by the wind.

"This shouldn't be possible," Ji Ju thought in shock, but it only fueled her determination to find the mysterious person.

"It seems the string is quite fragile," Lu Zhen mused as he felt the mark that had been draining his strength beginning to go dormant. He sensed the pulsating sensation fading away, replaced by stillness, as if the mark had fallen asleep.

Sensing this change, Lu Zhen couldn't help but feel relieved.

"It looks like it works," he said, staring at the mark with a greedy expression.

"Don't worry, I'll make better use of you than your previous owner," Lu Zhen thought with a confident smirk.

Although Lu Zhen wasn't certain whether this strange mark was truly alive or not, he had a gut feeling that it could prove quite beneficial in the future. Thus, he decided to keep it with him for now.

"Young master, I have found the rope and the leaves," Yu Bai said respectfully as he appeared beside Lu Zhen, handing over the materials.

"Oh, then let's go quickly," Lu Zhen responded decisively. Since he had severed the string that connected the mark, its owner might have already noticed. He didn't want to face these an unknown emeies without understanding what he wes dealing with.

"Know yourself, know your enemy, and you will win every war." The saying of Lao Zhu, which Lu Zhen had enjoyed reading in his past life for fun, was somethinge Lu Zhen knew by heart.

Lu Zhen grasped the thick twisted rope that Yu Bai had found and couldn't help but marvel at its sheer size. The rope was about 2 inches thick. When Lu Zhen gave it a gentle pull, it didn't break, which greatly satisfied him. Even that casual tug had the power of an average martial trainee, so the rope's durability impressed him.

Curiously, he asked Yu Bai, "Where did you get this, Old Bai?"

"Young master, you can easily obtain this from those ancient trees," Yu Bai explained, pointing at the towering trees that almost seemed to touch the heavens.

"Oh, I see," Lu Zhen replied, understanding the source.

The trees in this world were incredibly oversized. Even ordinary trees were around two kilometres tall, and the ancient tree Yu Bai was indicating exceeded that height. Wild beasts, in contrast, hadn't increased in size to match the trees. Lu Zhen hadn't yet known any wild beasts that were 2 kilometres tall. Typically, as beasts grew stronger, their size increased, but not to the exaggerated extent of these trees.

Lu Zhen wagered that if one of these ancient trees were to fall, even a first-rank martial artist might not survive.

Without further delay, Lu Zhen used the rope to bind Xia Mei in a restraining fashion. He began by securing both her hands behind her back in a tight zigzag pattern. As he did so, He could feel her soft skin against his arms, although in some areas, it seemed rough, likely from fighting all day.

Seeing the tightly twisted rope bound to her skin as her mountain peaks poked out of the rope, even Lu Zhen couldn't help but gulp. He felt a strong desire to claim this woman for himself, but the owner of the mysterious mark might arrive at any moment. Suppressing his emotions, he continued to wrap the rope around her body until she was completely encased in it.

After doing that lu zhen took the leaves which were as big as jiang xue and enloped her in it.

"Let's go now, Old Bai," Lu Zhen said as he darted off carrying Xia Mei on his shoulder, while Yu Bai carried the twins, maintaining the same swift pace as they raced through the forest.

52 Sufferings

"We're finally here," Lu Zhen declared upon spotting the enormous wall in the distance. Seeing this, Lu Zhen couldn't help but feel a slight sense of relief. He had been quite anxious about whether the creature, or whatever it was, behind him was still in pursuit.

However, it seemed that the creature had either given up the chase or couldn't locate them after Lu Zhen severed the string connection. Either way, Lu Zhen was relieved that they had avoided further trouble. Dealing with an unknown entity, especially one he had no knowledge about, had been far from pleasant.

"Let's pick up the pace," Lu Zhen urged as he quickened his stride while carrying Xia Mei.

Lu Zhen could hear Xia Mei's breathing, indicating that she was already awake. However, since she chose to remain silent for the time being, Lu Zhen decided not to speak either. He remained vigilant, ready to react if she made any sudden movements.

With Xia Mei securely bound by ropes and concealed with leaves, he felt confident that he could react swiftly if she made any sudden movements. And it was even better if she was so obedient. Lu Zhen increased his pace even faster.

Seeing the increased pace of Lu Zhen, Yu Bai also sped up.

The dim sun rays fell on Lu Zhen and Yu Bai. It was still winter; however, it wasn't that cold for Lu Zhen.

"Not bad. We reached here in one day," Lu Zhen mused to himself. After all, on foot, it would have taken approximately three days to just reach the city. However, since Lu Zhen and Yu Bai were going at their full speed, they took only a day to arrive.

Lu Zhen saw the long line of people all waiting to enter the city gate.

"Cough, cough... Mom, when will I get to eat?" A malnourished child weakly asked. She had barely any energy left and couldn't even cry, appearing to be close to death.

"Don't worry, my daughter; we will soon," the mother said as she sobbed. However, the mother didn't waste even her tears; she fed them to her daughter, providing the child with a little satisfaction for her thirst.

Lu Zhen's ears twitched as he observed the crowd of people lining up, all of whom seemed famished. There were numerous people in the crowd like the mother and daughter.

Seeing this, Lu Zhen sighed but didn't take any action. He knew he was no saviour and had no plans to become one.

Lu Zhen recognized himself as very selfish, and this would never change. He considered his own life above all else, so he had no intention of trying to be a saviour.

After all, Lu Zhen understood the truth: being a saviour was only ideal in fantasies. If you truly became a hero, you would live a short life, and Lu Zhen had no interest in a short life. He wanted to live a long, self-fulfilling one, and anyone who tried to disrupt that was undoubtedly his enemy.

However, Lu Zhen found it strange that so many people had come to the city this time. He was certain that when he had left the city, although there were some refugees, there weren't as many as there were now lining up in the crowd. It was strange that in just the few days he was gone, such a large influx of people had already crowded the area.

"There must be a war somewhere," Lu Zhen thought, as there were far too many refugees to count.

There weren't any kingdoms or rules in this place, unlike the novels Lu Zhen had read. There were only cities like Phoenix City, which were ruled by major families, or there were sects that held territories even larger than the families. There was no such thing as royalty, and nobody ruled an exaggerated place. Lu Zhen wasn't certain about the reasons behind this arrangement, but he understood that such a structure often led to conflicts. In many places, especially those without even a single first-stage martial artist, disputes and battles were as common as daily meals, fueled by human greed.

In fact, Phoenix City was quite a peaceful place compared to those other places. The city was stabilized by the four first-rank martial artists that the four major families possessed, which kept each other in check. However, seeing the fragile balance that was preventing the four major families from breaking apart, Lu Zhen knew that a war would likely start soon if things continued this way. It seemed inevitable.

"I must reach the first stage martial artist before the war starts," Lu Zhen thought with determination.

However, before he could focus on that goal, he had to navigate through the sea of people blocking his way.

Since Lu Zhen first exited the carriage, which bore the symbolic symbol of the Lu family, he was easily allowed to leave. However, now that he was barefooted, people wouldn't recognize him, so he would have to navigate through the sea of these people before reaching the gate, which was quite a tedious process through and through.

Thinking quickly, Lu Zhen said to Yu Bai, "Let's just jump."

He compressed his powerful muscles, generating an explosive surge of energy that coursed through his body and into the ground. Then, with a forceful push, he propelled himself into the air using his sheer strength.

Stunned by his young master's actions, Yu Bai realized that navigating through the crowd would be a lengthy process. He decided to follow Lu Zhen's lead and jumped, utilizing his qi to assist him.

"Mother, look up," a child exclaimed, her hungry eyes filled with curiosity.

The mother followed her daughter's gaze and saw people flying through the air. She immediately bowed, taking her daughter's head and bowing as well.

"I am sorry, Immortal, for looking up to you," the woman said, her face displaying nervousness and panic.

Others in the crowd also noticed the two individuals in the air and followed suit, bowing in fear.

Observing the crowd's worship for no apparent reason, Lu Zhen found it a bit strange. "Are the common people in this world ignorant of martial artists?" he wondered.

Ignoring the bowing crowd, Lu Zhen and Yu Bai landed directly in front of the city gate.

A resounding boom echoed as Lu Zhen touched down, and Yu Bai landed beside him. However, before they could take another step, a spear was pointed at them, and a self-righteous voice demanded, "Halt! Who are you, and what are you carrying?"

53 Fe Cai

Lu Zhen looked at the person who was pointing his spear at him with an emotionless expression; however, Lu Zhen's crimson eyes had an amused glint, as if he was watching an idiot.

There were two guards there: one was pointing the spear at Lu Zhen, and the other was just standing there with a smirk on his face.

The guy pointing the spear at Lu Zhen had golden hair and a lean physique, with blue eyes that made him quite handsome enough to compare to Lu Zhen. However, he had a feminine charm, whereas Lu Zhen's charm was muscular. He wore the classical captain guard uniform of Phoenix City, with a metal bracelet accentuating his green robes and pants.

However, Lu Zhen didn't reply; he just stared at the person as if looking at an idiot.

Seeing this, the spearman pointing his spear at Lu Zhen frowned.

"Fei Cai, are you trying to catch another fat sheep?" the other person besides him said in a whisper, smirking with knowing eyes.

There were always some fat sheeps who were refugee martial trainees who became arrogant because they thought they could be of importance here. They were called fat sheep because they could be sent to the mines as punishment, which would always earn them quite a bonus in their salary. These arrogant martial trainees were always the fattest sheep that a guard could get and delighted the guards when they showed themselves. After all, although it might seem like jumping that high was a great feat for an ordinary person, any martial trainee could accomplish such a thing if they were willing to work for it. Seeing the ragged clothes of the two, the guard was sure that they were just refugee martial trainees.

However, Fei Cai frowned upon hearing this. "It is our duty to guard here. How can we add personal interest here?" Fei Cai said with a frown on his face when he heard the guy, as he stopped the two people who were one young and another old, but they both were muscular.

Lu Zhen's ears twitched when he heard this, and his amusing eyes became even more so.

"Didn't you hear me? Who are you?" Fei Cai said as his spear went even closer to Lu Zhen.

Seeing no reply, Fei Cai became a little confused as he saw the young man in front of him looking at him with even more amusement, as if watching a great show called "I am an idiot."

Fei Cai narrowed his eyes as he looked at the two more carefully. The old guy was carrying two people in his arms, walking casually with his clothes dirty from all the mud, and his clothes were a little tattered. He had a muscular build. The young man was carrying a leaf loaded with something, although Fei Cai didn't know what it was. The young man was handsome, with black long hair and red crimson eyes.

Still, they shouldn't be good people if they are carrying people and being so audacious. However, before he could stop them, the other guard caught a glimpse of Lu Zhen, which made his eyes widen with pure horror, and his body started shaking uncontrollably. He hurriedly stopped Fei Cai by lowering the spear.

"What's the matter with you?" Fei Cai said as he turned back to see the trembling guard with terrified eyes.

"This‚Ä¶this‚Ä¶" the guard couldn't utter a word, knowing that he had messed up. However, an insidious plan came to his mind to save his life as his brain worked faster than ever before. "Fei Cai, are you crazy? That's the young master of the Lu family," the guard said with a cold tone, although there were beads of sweat on his body, visible if you looked closely.

When Fei Cai heard this, his eyes widened, and he gritted his teeth but immediately put down his spear as he bowed with reluctance. "I am sorry, young master," Fei Cai said respectfully, though there was a hint of indignation in his tone.

The other guard also immediately bowed and said, "Young master, I am extremely sorry because of my idiot friend here, you have been disturbed." The guard said with a smirk on his face, thinking he had put all the blame on his friend.

Hearing the betrayal of his so-called friend in just a moment, Fei Cai couldn't help but feel bitter. He knew that the guy was a faker who would stab you in the back as long as it benefited him. However, he didn't feel any remorse for his actions, as he believed he was just doing his job.

Nevertheless, Lu Zhen remained in place, simply gazing at them. With no response forthcoming, the two guards exchanged furtive glances. Upon catching sight of Lu Zhen's piercing crimson eyes, an unexplainable mental pressure descended upon them, causing them to inexplicably break into a sweat. Although Fei Cai was fine, the other guard's uniform was already soaked with sweat.

Fei Cai became even more bitter when he saw no reply from Lu Zhen. Actually, the guards guarding the gates were a collective group of people directly under the four major families. So, they could be arrogant to anyone except the direct descendants of the family or anyone related to the four major families, who were like novelties to them - nothing more than dogs to the four major families. Offending the infamous young master of the Lu family was like a death sentence to them, although they had heard that the Lu family young master had considerably improved and had become friendlier, they didn't know the authenticity of the rumour. Actually, it wasn't even their fault that Lu Zhen was stopped; after all, the direct descendants had their special carriage that they always travelled in, so they couldn't even dare to imagine that Lu Zhen could appear barefooted and with his clothes messed up too.

"Open the gates," Lu Zhen finally said after a long silence.

"Yes, young master," the subordinates of Fei Cai and the other guard quickly said with panic as they pulled the lever.

"If you can survive this, we will meet again in the future," Lu Zhen said as he looked at Fei Cai before leaving with Yu Bai, wearing a mysterious smile.

Hearing this, Fei Cai's eyes widened.

54 Adapt with Bloodline

"Interesting, so that Fe Cai guy has a similar aura to Xia Mei," Lu Zhen thought as he sensed the instinctual urge to kill gradually subside.

"That guy must also have a Bloodline," Lu Zhen speculated with a furrowed brow.

When he had first encountered Xia Mei, he had felt an instinctual desire to mate. This time, when he met the golden-haired guy, the same murderous instinct had welled up.

However, Lu Zhen had grown more accustomed to these emotions originating from his bloodline, allowing him to control them better.

"It seems like the Adapt skill is doing its job well," Lu Zhen thought with satisfaction. He could now almost entirely manage the urges stemming from his bloodline. As his Adapt skill continued to level up, he believed he would gain full mastery over his bloodline. When that day came, he might be able to harness the full power of the Vulgrith form without losing control of his mind.

Reflecting on this, Lu Zhen felt content that he had another card in his arsenal. He didn't consider the Vulgrith form a hidden trump card previously because it was an unstable factor. Even if he were to obtain the scroll, he wouldn't use it recklessly. The form was largely impractical. Although he could sense that in the Vulgrith form, he might hold his own against a second-stage martial artist in a direct confrontation, that was a big "if." In that form, Lu Zhen was still not fully awakened, and his mind was clouded. Even after slaughtering an entire camp, his berserk state had only been momentarily sated. However, if Lu Zhen could gain complete control over this form, it could become his second most powerful trump card, right behind Gluttony.

Thinking about this matter left him somewhat satisfied. However, he couldn't help but ponder an essential point that Yu Bai had mentioned.

"Aren't Bloodline users supposed to be rare?" Lu Zhen furrowed his brows.

Yu Bai had emphasized that Bloodline users were exceedingly uncommon. They were like hidden gems scattered throughout the vast world, most of them choosing to live reclusive lives, hidden away in remote corners, in order to control their instincts. Yet, here was Lu Zhen, who had already encountered at least two of them.

Lu Zhen wanted to discuss this with Yu Bai, but the bustling street was hardly the right place for such a conversation. He decided to leave it for later, to be discussed when they returned to the Lu estate.

As he looked at his shoulder, where Xia Mei was securely tied up in ropes and concealed with leaves, a wicked curiosity sparked in Lu Zhen's eyes.

"How does this Bloodline actually work?" he thought with an evil smirk on his face which looked like a villain's smile.

Underneath the leafy coverings, Xia Mei shivered as she felt chills at her back for some reasons she couldn't quite understand.

Lu Zhen and Yu Bai continued their journey through the bustling streets, where the cacophony of voices and the hustle and bustle of people filled the air.

"The crowd here is overwhelming," Lu Zhen thought to himself. He was greeted by a sea of people moving about, each engrossed in their own activities.

Children played gleefully on the streets, hawkers loudly advertised their wares, and lu zhen could smell the tantalising aromas wafted from nearby food stalls. Almost everyone seemed to be wearing smiles, content in their daily routines.

Since Lu Zhen had always travelled in the carriage, he had never seen the sheer intensity of people. But now, seeing the bustling street filled with people, Lu Zhen was undoubtedly shocked.

Amidst the crowd of people, Lu Zhen and Yu Bai made their way toward the Lu family estate.

However, as they continued to travel, lu zhen heard a peculiar sound.

"Myra Fangs, said to grant an ordinary person the ability to become a martial artist instantly!"

"Get it today for a discounted price of just ten gold biscuits!"

Lu Zhen's ears twitched at the mention of "Myra Fangs." He regarded the hawker with a funny expression.

Since he was already here, Lu Zhen decided to give it a try.

Lu Zhen closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, they turned golden. But when he gazed upon it once more, his eyes widened in shock.

"This... this can't be..." Lu Zhen thought in disbelief, rubbing his eyes and scrutinising the item again.

The same prompt appeared as he continued to examine the item.

"Let's go there, Old Bai," Lu Zhen said, as he swung his right hand pushing a person who was in front of him.

The person was angry as he was about to curse however when the person saw lu zhen his eyes tuned terrified as he took back his word with a gulp swallowing his own saliva.

"Of course, young master," Yu Bai replied as they manoeuvred through the bustling crowd toward the vendor who was lu zhen saw fro previously.

"Old Yao, you can't seriously expect people to believe this nonsense," a child chimed in, overhearing the hawker's speech as he took the ball which mistakenly was thrown in the shop.

"Hmph, what do you know, kid? Everything in my shop is authentic! You want a spanking, is that it?" Old Yao retorted, shooing away the child who had retrieved a ball near his stall.

"I don't believe your stories for a second. Do you think anyone would fall for this?" the child taunted, a smirk on his face. His teeth appeared to have gone without washing for quite some time, emitting a foul odour that filled the shop.

Old Yao considered this briefly before his smirk turned into a confident smile. Leaning closer to the child's ear, he whispered, "You'd be surprised, kid. There are more gullible people in this world than you think."

The child raised an incredulous eyebrow. "You can't be serious."

With a sly smile, Old Yao responded, "Heheheh... trust me, I am." Upon catching a whiff of the unpleasant smell, Old Yao quickly covered his nose with two fingers and exclaimed, "Get lost, you little brat! This is bad for my business."

"Alright, I'll go," the child conceded, his tone lightening. He quickly made his exit, muttering, "Kids these days."

Old Yao, still exasperated, shook his head and returned to hawking his unusual wares.

55 Bargaining

"The business should be fine as long as I find an idiot like the last time," Old Yao thought as his voice increased.

He finally saw two people who were slowly walking towards him.

"Finally, idiots," Old Yao thought; however, seeing their muscle frame, he was a little afraid.

"How much for this?" Lu Zhen asked as he pointed at the item, which was what Old Yao was over exaggerating.

"One gold biscuits, nothing more, nothing less," Old Yao said as he huffed and sat back in the chair arrogantly.

Hearing this, Lu Zhen frowned a little. The currency for mortals was divided into iron, silver, and gold.

An iron coin could buy you a dark bread, which was eaten by the poor and was as cold and hard as rock. A normal person's average income was about one silver coin, equivalent to 100 iron coins, and one golden biscuit was equivalent to 100 silver coins.

A normal family could last a month with just 10 silver coins, and the old man asking for one golden biscuit was like asking for 10 months of ordinary family expenses.

Although this amount was nothing for Lu Zhen, asking him this much for a shady scam item the old man probably got from shady scam deals was a little too much. Lu Zhen felt like he was being taken advantage of, and he didn't like this feeling as he got no benefits whatsoever.

If he got benefits, he wouldn't mind, but since the old man was just taking advantage of Lu Zhen, he had an idea of what to do.

Although he could just kill the old man and get whatever he wanted, as his family basically owned 1/4 of the entire city, it didn't mean he could do whatever he wanted. He had worked very hard to gain a little reputation after his small acts. However, if he really killed the old man, he would lose all that reputation.

He still considered reputation a little, after all, sometimes reputation was even mightier than strength, and Lu Zhen wasn't one to neglect anything that could potentially benefit him. These meager money offerings weren't even worth a glance.

"Give me all these items for one gold biscuit. Deal or no deal?" Lu Zhen said casually as he swept his hand over everything in the old man's shop.

Hearing this, the old man's eyes widened as he said, "Young master, can you really do this to this poor old man? I am just an ordinary man trying to make a living in his old age. Every item here is genuine and can be sold for at least one gold biscuit. Aren't you being too overbearing?" The old man said with puppy eyes filled with tears, looking at Lu Zhen as if he were a victim.

Hearing this, Lu Zhen just sneered.

"Alright, no deal," Lu Zhen said as he walked away with Yu Bai.

Seeing this, Old Yao just watched in despair as his money-making bank was going away.

However, he continued to stare at Lu Zhen's back, desperately hoping that Lu Zhen would turn around. Yet, as he observed that Lu Zhen remained unmoved, the old man's eyes filled with despair.

He hurriedly stood up from his seat and ran as fast as he could, as if his life depended on it.

"Young master, please wait, I am willing," the old man said with some panic.

Hearing this, Lu Zhen sneered inwardly. However, he had a thoughtful expression on his face.

Seeing the thoughtful expression of Lu Zhen, the old man panicked as he said, "What happened, young master?" The old man said hurriedly.

"Hmm, seeing you readily agree, I will also agree," Lu Zhen said as they all returned to the shop again.

After they arrived in the shop, however, Lu Zhen had a confused expression on his face.

"Young master?" The old man asked as he somehow started to sweat buckets for no reason.

"I changed my mind. I will only buy these goods if you tell me how you got these goods. If you tell me honestly, I will give you two gold biscuits," Lu Zhen said, with an unclear expression on his face as if he were hesitating.

"If you tell me a lie, you know the consequences," Lu Zhen said as he paused. "So where is your son?"

20:49

"Young master, I will tell you; it was..." Old Yao gulped hearing two gold biscuits as he started talking. However, before he could continue.

"If you don't tell me the truth, there will be consequences," Lu Zhen said as he stared at the old man with his crimson red eyes.

Seeing the eyes of Lu Zhen, Old Yao started to feel pressure out of nowhere as he started to sweat even more profusely just from Lu Zhen's stare.

Gulp!

A gulp sound resounded as the old man felt pressure like never before, as if he uttered even one false word, his neck would be severed right there.

"Sigh," Old Yao sighed as he started to tell the truth, as he could tell that these people were not someone he could mess with, even though they wore ragged clothes.

"Young master, this was given to me by my son, Yao Yi. He picked it from somewhere," Old Yao said with some resignation.

"Where?" Lu Zhen said with a cold tone.

"Please forgive me, young master. I don't know," Old Yao said with bitterness.

Hearing this, Lu Zhen found it to be likely.

"If you tell me a lie, you know the consequences," Lu Zhen said as he paused. "So where is your son?"

"Young master, my son is an adventurer who likes to go everywhere. He is out of this city," Old Yao hurriedly replied.

Hearing this, Lu Zhen frowned. However, since it was the case, he could only go with it for now.

"Alright, give me all these items for now," Lu Zhen said as he took out two gold biscuits from his pouch and handed them to the old man.

"After he comes back, you should come to the Lu mansion," Lu Zhen said with a commanding tone.

Hearing the Lu family name, the old man's eyes widened as he hurriedly bowed and didn't take the gold biscuits from Lu Zhen.

"Young master, I don't dare," Old Yao said with fear in his eyes as he trembled uncontrollably.

"Pack all these things up," Lu Zhen said as he placed the gold in the old man's hand.

"Yes, Young Master," Old Yao hurriedly packed all the things he had into a black sack he had at the corner of the makeshift table. He handed it to Lu Zhen.

However, before Lu Zhen could take the sack, he heard the loud noise of a carriage.

"Wait."

56 Cliche

Lu Zhen heard the noise as he looked at the one causing such trouble. When he saw the insignia of the Huang family, a boar, he frowned.

"Our Miss has come to this shop," a servant exited the carriage, and the crowd cleared the way for the Huang family.

Lu Zhen could see a purple slithoulite in the carriage as he narrowed his eyes.

"We are going to buy everything you have. How much do you want for it?" the guard said with an arrogant smirk.

However, seeing all the goods in Lu Zhen's hands, the guard frowned a little.

"Whoever you are, since you took all the goods, name your price. Our Miss will give it to you," the guard said arrogantly.

Hearing this, Lu Zhen just smirked as he slowly positioned his hands for a fight.

"Don't move, Old Bai," Lu Zhen telepathically communicated to Yu Bai.

"Yes, Young Master," Yu Bai replied, sending his voice transmission to Lu Zhen as he kept the weapon he was about to withdraw.

The servant narrowed his eyes when he saw that Lu Zhen was ready to fight.

"We are the Huang family," the servant announced loudly. However, Lu Zhen still stayed in a fighting position, confusing the servant.

A silence permeated the surroundings as nobody talked for minutes.

"Young Master, I wonder if you have any demands. I will fulfill them as long as you can give those items to us," Lu Zhen heard a female voice from inside the carriage where he could see the purple slithoulite of the woman.

"Young Miss, this is just a co‚Ä¶" the servant was about to say something; however, Lu Zhen wasn't in the mood to listen to a servant's flattery, so he immediately interrupted.

"Oh, then how much can you give me for this?" Lu Zhen said as he stared at the carriage, as if he could see the young Miss behind it.

"State your price," the female behind the carriage said with a cold voice.

Hearing this, Lu Zhen sneered.

"Alright, how about a qi stone mine?" Lu Zhen said with an expressionless face.

Hearing about a mine, the whole place went silent for a moment.

"How dare you‚Ä¶" the female resounded; however, Lu Zhen again interrupted.

"Didn't you say I can name my price? If you can't give me this price, then I'm not selling it," Lu Zhen said as he sneered.

Hearing this, the woman behind the carriage vaguely made some hand signs, which Lu Zhen could see vaguely.

The moment she did the hand sign, all the 20 to 30 guards moved toward Lu Zhen, surrounding him in moments.

However, Lu Zhen wasn't an idiot. Why would he stay still while his enemy was preparing?

With a swish sound, Lu Zhen just swiped his hands. The moment he did, a tearing sound spread as two people who were hit were split, splattering blood and organs on the ground.

"This‚Ä¶" the guards of the Huang family had widened eyes as they saw Lu Zhen killing them almost effortlessly.

The crowd who saw the scene of Lu Zhen killing the two people.

Some ran faster than they ever could to their place, and some just stared at the people Lu Zhen killed with curiosity and interest.

"Is he an idiot? Does he really think he can get away now that he has killed two servants?" a person said in the crowd while smirking.

"If it were me, I would ask for 10 gol‚Ä¶ No, 100 gold biscuits," another person said with envy in his eyes.

"We are going to watch a show this time."

Some people had their own thoughts as they stayed there, watching the unfolding events of the two who were confronting the Huang family.

"Get out of the way," a voice resounded as a person sidelined the guards and came.

The person wore yellow clothes with an insignia of a boar on his clothes.

"So you are also a martial artist, huh? Then take my qiang (spear)," the person said as all the ordinary guards in black uniforms let him enter with a smirk on their faces.

"Boss is going to teach him a lesson to the grave," the guards thought as they looked at Lu Zhen with pure anger and disgust.

"How clich√©," Lu Zhen thought as he stared at the man without making any moves.

"Sigh, I have gotten quite used to killing, huh‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen thought as he looked at the cold corpses of the two on the ground.

He couldn't feel much emotion killing them, like cutting grass, and he had adapted to these feelings long ago.

During fights, it was bound to happen that someone might die, and Lu Zhen sneered, as this would be his life from now on. Although he hoped it wouldn't, it would always be the case because, no matter how you hid, as long as you got stronger, you would eventually be found out one way or another.

So it was better to fight for benefits than sit around all day long, hoping for enlightenment that might never come, and you could die with regrets at the meager achievements you had made.

As he was contemplating, his ears twitched as he heard the sound of the spear swoosh, which made him frown.

"I almost forgot about this guy," Lu Zhen thought.

Almost instinctively, Lu Zhen caught the spear's tip with his finger.

Feeling unpleasant about being disturbed, he casually swung his right hand in a hook towards his attacker.

Before the spear man could react, Lu Zhen's punch connected with the man's head.

The spear man's eyes widened as he witnessed the lightning-fast swing of Lu Zhen's attack. Horror overtook him as he felt the devastating impact of the fist.

With a puncturing sound, Lu Zhen's punch directly connected with the head, and like a hammer hitting a watermelon, it burst like a watermelon.

His vision went blank as the headless body of the man fell to the ground.

Pitch!

With a pitch sound the blood of the person dyed the ground red.

A silence permeated the surroundings as an angry voice erupted with anger, from inside the carriage.

"You dare."

"Why wouldn't I dare?" Lu Zhen said casually.

"Let's go now," Lu Zhen said as he carried the bag in his other arm.

"Oh, as for you, know what to do‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen said as he looked to his right, where the old man was hurriedly trying to escape without making a sound.

"Yes, Young Master," the old man bowed in embarrassment. There was a deep fear in his eyes.

"You will die for sure for doing this," the angry voice resounded with some anger.

However, hearing this, Lu Zhen replied, "Sure, you can try," as he walked off.

"You‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen could hear the ragged breathing of the girl from inside the carriage.

Suddenly, he heard a rustling sound, which made him smirk internally. "Finally took the bait," Lu Zhen thought as he smirked.

"Here, carry this," Lu Zhen said as he handed the sack containing all the items from the old man's shop to Yu Bai.

"Yes, Young Master," Yu Bai said, confused. However, he couldn't be confused for long as his eyes widened with realization when he saw the woman getting out of her carriage with nunchucks in her hands.

She quickly covered the distance between Lu Zhen and her as she took the right side of the nunchucks in her hands and swung it to the right.

The moment she swung, Lu Zhen's smirk widened into a grin as he thought, "She took the bait."

As her nunchucks' right handle was about to make contact with Lu Zhen's back, a small smirk appeared behind the veil she was wearing.

However, before she could be any more triumphant, suddenly, Lu Zhen turned around and effortlessly caught the right handle of the nunchucks.

Her momentum caused her to momentarily lose her balance and almost fall to the ground.

However before she could fall further, Lu Zhen pulled the nunchucks, causing her to come towards him, and he caught her by the waist.

Her face flushed with embarrassment as she said, "You‚Ä¶"

Lu Zhen could feel her butter like waist of her, but hearing the anger in her voice, he let go, and she fell face-first into the muddy ground.

"Bastard‚Ä¶" She said as she turned around to see the cold crimson eyes of Lu Zhen, who was watching her like prey.

Instantly, her back went cold as she started to tremble uncontrollably. She could feel an aura around Lu Zhen that made her extremely terrified.

Huang li felt like he would really kill her in moments if she didn't do exactly what he wanted, which made her survival instinct kick in.

She immediately sat with her legs in front, in a seiza sitting style.

Seeing the obedient girl, Lu Zhen patted her crimson hair. "Good girl, what's your name?" he asked with a smirk on his face, noticing her trembling.

"My‚Ä¶ my name is Huang Li," Lu Zhen heard her trembling voice.

"Am I that scary?" He thought to himself, but then realized he had unknowingly released a sliver of his aura. "I need to control my urges," Lu Zhen thought with a frown. However, not forgetting about the girl, he said, "You just have to follow me, alright?" with a pause, "or else‚Ä¶"

Huang Li immediately nodded her head.

"Good," Lu Zhen nodded, satisfied, as he patted the girl's head. "Come, follow me," Lu Zhen said as he took her hand.

As they left, people made way for Lu Zhen, their eyes filled with fear.

Old Bai carried the two Lu Zhi and Lu Qing in one arm and the goods in the other as he followed Lu Zhen.

"You can't take Miss away‚Ä¶" a guard said to Lu Zhen, but he and Yu Bai just ignored the servant as they made their way.

Seeing this, the servants were filled with disbelief as they watched Lu Zhen leave with their young Miss.

"Old Master is going to kill me," the servant shouted out loud as he cried. The other servants' expressions were also bitter.

The people who watched were all terrified.

"My god, did he really kill a martial trainee so easily?"

"He must be a third-stage martial artist."

"Isn't he too young?"

"There has never been such a young third-stage martial artist in our city, have there been any?"

"But too bad‚Ä¶" some people just shook their heads.

"Since he has offended the Huang family, even if that young person is a third-stage martial artist, he will die miserably." Some people just sighed hearing this.

Meanwhile, Lu Zhen and Yu Bai made their way to the Lu family estate.

"Not bad, the first time I went out, I have two beauties in my arms," Lu Zhen thought as he tightened his hold on the leaf-covered Xia Mei, faintly feeling her ass. He then eyed Huang Li, who was following him like a little kitten.

Altought she was dirty from all the mud in her body. However, she was an attractive woman for sure.

With a crimson hair and her slims smooth like butter waist and her long legs and her medium sized ass and big breast.

Lu Zhen could give her a rating of 10 out of 12.

Actually this was not the reason while he captured the girl cough‚Ä¶ this was not the only reason he captured the girl.

There was another reason; Lu Zhen had the appraisal skill, so he could see the value of these items. However, how did Huang Li know about these treasures? That was what he was curious about.

As for offending the Huangs, he didn't mind, as he had already offended them the moment he took the goods they were eyeing. Given that situation, Lu Zhen thought, "Why not go all the way?"

"It will be fun interrogating her‚Ä¶" Lu Zhen thought, an evil smirk plastered on his face.

"Young Master, we have arrived," Yu Bai said.

Lu Zhen woke up from his contemplation as he looked at the Lu family estate, still radiating a luxurious aura that gave off a luxurious vibe.

"Let's go," Lu Zhen said as they made their way inside.

58 Hidden Room

"We greet the Young master," the guards said respectfully as they opened the gates for Lu Zhen and Yu Bai, wearing strange expressions.

Their ragged clothes caught their attention as they found both lu zhen and yu bai with dirty clothes. And the carriage was nowhere to be seen as they couldn't find a single trace of it which made them confused and a little terrified.

Yu Bai carrying two people and a bag caught the guards' attention.

As they saw Lu Zhen, their eyes widened. They could see a woman obediently following him, holding her hands with one hand and a leaf-wrapped package in his other hand.

However they were just common guards guarding the estate. So how could they even dare to think that they could interrogate their young master?

"Isn't that the young miss of the Huang family?" the guards thought with shock. They were filled with questions but didn't dare ask as they obediently opened the gates.

"Young master, we should separate for now..." Yu Bai suggested as he handed the sack containing the items to a servant.

"Alright," Lu Zhen replied, eyeing his dirty clothes and the two women.

He noticed the terrified look in Huang Li's eyes.

"Did you really think I was an ordinary commoner?" Lu Zhen asked Huang Li.

Hearing his cold voice, Huang Li snapped out of her thoughts. Though bitterness still marked her expression, a faint glimmer of hope appeared in her eyes.

"Even if you're from the Lu family, so what? Our Huang family is also one of the four major families of the city," Huang Li said with newfound courage, facing Lu Zhen's emotionless gaze.

"Are you trying to incite a war by capturing me?" Huang Li continued to provoke, growing bolder.

"Miss Li really thinks highly of me. I was just acting in self-defence. After all, you attacked me first like a mindless fool who only has beauty for show," Lu Zhen said, stating the facts with a sincere expression.

"You‚Ä¶" Huang Li was about to retort but found herself speechless as Lu Zhen was telling the truth.

Her foolish decision to attack Lu Zhen, even after witnessing him effortlessly kill a martial trainee, had landed her in this predicament. Recognizing her own foolishness, she fell into silence.

Seeing her silenced, Lu Zhen smirked. "This girl isn't very smart," he thought.

"Miss Li, I wonder why you were so adamant about buying the goods so much that you came to a commoner's shop personally," Lu Zhen inquired, his face revealing confusion.

16:05

Huang Li's continued silence led to Lu Zhen's frown deepening. "I will make you regret not telling me now," he whispered as he got close to her ears, sending a shiver down her spine.

"I should keep them in the dungeon for now," Lu Zhen thought as he began heading toward his palace.

"Follow me," he instructed the servant carrying the sack, and they separated.

Lu Zhen knew that Yu Bai was going to his mother, which didn't bother him because he had achieved what he wanted to show. It was better to have Yu Bai report to his mother rather than doing it himself.

Navigating through the Lu family state where he could see every single servant now and then, all of whom bowed upon seeing him, Lu Zhen reached his palace.

"You can leave the sack here," Lu Zhen told the servant, who respectfully nodded and gently placed the sack on the ground.

"Then I will take my leave, young master," the servant said.

"Go," Lu Zhen said, handing the servant a golden biscuit.

Upon receiving the golden biscuit, the servant's eyes widened with excitement. He wholeheartedly bowed 44 times straight, saying, "Thank you, young master," before departing.

Lu Zhen opened the luxurious door, decorated with pure gold carvings. There was no lock on it because he didn't need one.

"Young master!" The moment Lu Zhen opened the door, Little Lily came running and hugged him tightly.

Feeling her embrace, a small smile formed on Lu Zhen's face as he affectionately patted her head.

"Lily, you should prepare some food as I am hungry," Lu Zhen said.

"Yes, young master."

Little Lily's expression turned slightly puzzled when she noticed the women behind Lu Zhen.

"Don't worry about her; she's a prisoner," Lu Zhen said loudly to Little Lily, making Huang Li clench her fists in frustration.

Lu Zhen led them both to his room. The room was quite simple, but spacious, with a large bed and tasteful furnishings, neither extravagant nor empty.

There were some woods at the corner of the room.

There was a huge bed in the middle where lu zhen slept with the symbol of dragons carved on it.

He looked to his left side of the bed where there was a strange statue of a bonsai on a table.

The bonsai statue was made of bronze and copper, vividly detailed down to every single curve. It could be said to be a masterpiece with every single detail.

Lu Zhen touched the surface of the statue, feeling its smoothness, as he turned the statue around, under the witness of huang lu's surprised gaze the statue actually turned around.

Creak!

The moment he did, a door opened in his room, and a dirty and rusty smell immediately filled the room.

Smelling the rusty odour, Lu Zhen frowned; however, he wasn't going to stay there anyway.

"Whatever," Lu Zhen thought as he tightly gripped Huang Li's hands and went inside the room.

The room was quite simple, with bookshelves that appeared to be too old.

"Hmm, these will do for now," Lu Zhen thought to himself as he placed the leaf containing Xia Mei on a nearby table.

As he tapped his foot on the ground, he could feel a slimy texture in the ground. It was so sticky that even Lu Zhen's foot got stuck quite a lot.

The smell became even more disgusting as Lu Zhen entered, especially with his heightened senses due to his superhuman abilities; his sense of smell was even stronger, making Lu Zhen feel disgusted.

However, the smell slowly started to decrease as Lu Zhen felt that he was slowly adapting to the odor.

"Adapt skill," Lu Zhen thought with excitement. The smell was still there, and he could still clearly detect it, but it didn't seem to be as disgusting now.

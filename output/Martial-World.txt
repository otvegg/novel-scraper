Chapter 924(A) – Settling the Cycle of Karma

…

…

…

The space within the Extreme Violet Ring was sizable and comfortable. When Lin Ming received the Lin Family Clan into his spatial ring, he had left the majority of the buildings intact. As Lin Ming saw these buildings, memories began to emerge within his mind.

Hidden Smoke Hall. Rain Flower Pavilion.

As Lin Ming looked at these places that once resembled the most noble and upper crust society of the family clan, he felt emotions swell within him. These were areas that only the young masters and ladies of the family clan could enter. They would ride on wooden sedans and enjoy the flowery scenery. They would be accompanied by groups of servants as well as having trays of fruits and exquisite desserts waiting for them at any time.

When Lin Ming was young, this represented the ultimate lifestyle in his mind. He had longed for this type of wealthy life, and thought that after he grew up and reached the peak of martial arts, he could also become such a top character. But now, none of this was what he pursued.

In the past, Lin Ming came to the Lin Mansion several times with his father to prepare for great feasts. His job was to debone meat. With his sharp boning knife in hand, he would slice vicious beasts into various parts, and watch as his father cooked them into a number of different dishes.

Besides that, he and the Lin Family didn’t have much exchanges.

In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed. To martial artists that lived for tens of thousands of years, ten years was an insignificant period of time. But as Lin Ming recalled the memories of his childhood, all of those scenes and recollections of the past seemed blurry and remote.

The Lin Family descendants all arranged themselves according to rank and seniority and stood behind Lin Wanshan. A respected mortal family like the Lin Family had strict rules and tedious customs. Now that they were greeting Lin Ming, they naturally couldn’t show poor etiquette.

As the Lin Family descendants looked at Lin Ming, their eyes were filled with both respect and unease. To a legendary character like Lin Ming, all of them had been influenced by him, but very few had ever seen or heard from him. In the past several years, the Lin Family’s status had grown several times over, and they had faintly become the Sky Fortune Kingdom’s number one family.

Lin Wanshan had been assigned the title of Duke Lin. The Lin Family’s properties and businesses were countless. They could be said to be at the zenith of their glory. Even the Sky Fortune Kingdom Emperor Yang Lin had to be respectful when seeing Lin Wanshan. Not only did Lin Wanshan not need to bow, but he was even offered a site. In private, Yang Lin also had to call Lin Wanshan ‘Uncle Lin’.

Such respect and courtesy was rarely honored ever since the founding of the Sky Fortune Kingdom. Lin Wanshan wasn’t an idiot to think that Yang Lin treated him with respect because he appreciated his talents. Rather, all of this was because of Lin Ming. Even Yang Lin becoming the Emperor was because of Lin Ming’s support.

The truth was that after Lin Ming left the Seven Profound Valleys, the Lin Family descendants had no idea what degree Lin Ming had reached. They only knew that he was extremely fierce. Even after Situ Yaoxi and the others came, they still had difficulty understanding the situation of the world; those people already completely surpassed their imaginations.

Some Lin Family juniors and even elders began to pay their respects to Lin Ming and bow. This wasn’t unusual. According to the customs of the Sky Fortune Kingdom, if an Empress were produced within the family clan, then when the empress returned to her home, there would be a grand festive celebration. Everyone in the family would bathe in incense and there would be great banquets for days, ceremonial worshipping of ancestors, and events all around. Even the Patriarch of the family would have to bow down on both knees, even if he were the Empress’s father.

Now Lin Ming’s status was countless times higher than a mere Empress of the Sky Fortune Kingdom. According to the customs of a mortal family, everyone had to bow to Lin Ming.

There were many Lin Family descendants. Merely among the servants there were over a thousand sharing the same surname. As Lin Ming gazed upon such a large family, he actually didn’t feel much of a sense of belonging.

In his mind, his true family were his parents, his sister, and Lin Xiaodong, Mu Qianyu and Qin Xingxuan. Everyone else could only be considered distant relatives.

“Everyone, there is no need for such ceremony. Uncle Lin, please rise, I cannot afford such courtesy. When I left home in the past to pursue the road of martial arts, I never imagined I would bring such great blessings and such great disasters to the Lin Family. After the beast tide ended, I haven’t set foot in Green Mulberry City. I didn’t think that you all would be drawn into my troubles.

“Nephew Lin, you can’t say that. As long as the family clan remains prosperous in the future, then let alone losing a hand, I wouldn’t even blink if I had to sacrifice my life.

Lin Wanshan honestly and earnestly said. To a traditional respected family, the prosperity of the family clan and the passing of the glory onto the next generation was the most important matter. Even a clansman’s life was expendable in the face of such an important matter.

Lin Ming’s eyes moved to Lin Wanshan’s left hand and he saw that his hand had already been cut off. Lin Ming sighed. In this calamity, many Lin Family descendants should have died. There were even many that had lost their feet or arms, and all of this was because of him. He took out some pill bottles from his spatial ring and said, “Here are some medicinal pills that can regenerate limbs. For all those who had their arms or legs cut off, please take these pills to restore them.”

Spirit medicines that could regenerate mortal limbs weren’t considered too precious. Lin Ming had put out many different types of medicines, but none of these medicines were suitable for high level martial artists. To a high level martial artist that had crossed Life Destruction, their body would reform into a spirit body. If their arm was cut down and an ordinary untempered arm was attached in place of the old, then that would become nothing but a burden to them. In a fight, once true essence flooded into that limb, it would simply explode when it became unable to withstand the amount of true essence.

Of course, to a mortal and their daily life, none of this was a problem.

As Lin Wanshan saw all of these spirit medicines, his heart was overjoyed. No one wished to be disabled for the rest of their lives. As the rest of the Lin Family descendants saw these spirit medicines, that tiny trace of resentment they held towards Lin Ming also vanished.

“And here are some other medicines. Although they are useless to me, if a mortal were to take them, they can prologue life and eliminate all diseases. They can live for over a hundred some years. As for the rest, it’s to help raise the martial artists. Allow the martial arts masters of the family to eat these and it’ll allow them to break through the body transformation realm, and help their cultivation increase by leaps and bounds. If a Houtian master were to eat these medicines, it can even help them break through to the Xiantian realm.

As Lin Ming spoke, he took out another massive pile of medicinal pills. All of these medicines pills had been obtained from the countless martial artists he had killed. These were only basic low level medicines, but to a small sect they were priceless treasures.

Just these dozens of medicinal pills that could allow a Houtian master to break into the Xiantian realm was enough to make a third-grade sect go crazy with jealousy. One can see this from just how much effort Qin Ziya had spent in order to obtain a Heaven Opening Pill.

“These, these are spirit pills that can allow a Houtian master to break into the Xiantian realm?” Lin Wanshan gulped with some difficulty. He had some experience and certainly knew how precious these types of miracle medicines were. They were truly precious! A single one of these pills was equivalent to a city!

Lin Ming had casually handed out several dozen of these pills. That was equal to several dozen cities worth of wealth. Lin Wanshan was unavoidably uneasy that such precious treasures were placed within the family clan.

Lin Ming saw through Lin Wanshan’s thoughts and said, “Rest assured, the sects that will be jealous of these pills are small sects; they won’t dare to move against the Lin Family. As for those sects that dare to move against the Lin Family, they won’t care about these low level medicines.”

Lin Ming waved his hand. These words caused all of the Lin Family descendants to fall into a incredulous daze. To casually hand over so many pills on the level of a Heaven Opening Pill and still call them low level medicines, Lin Ming’s boundary was simply unimaginable.

Lin Ming thought for a moment and then pulled out a set of puppets from his spatial ring. There were a total of 18 puppets, and each one resembled a cruel demon, grim and savage as if they were devils that had crawled up from hell.

These were the puppets left behind by Corpsemancer. He had used these puppets when he was still at a low stage of Life Destruction, but after he entered the Destiny Decree, these puppets weren’t too useful to him anymore. They remained as only part of his collection. Lin Ming originally didn’t have any use for them, but now they actually came in handy.

Lin Ming took out a jade slip and placed his soul mark on it. He poured some true essence into the jade slip and passed it to Lin Wanshan “Just for emergencies. I give these puppets to the Lin Family as protective guards. If the Lin Family suffers a disaster one day, they can use this jade slip to control the puppets and safely pass through that calamity. This jade slip can be given to the Patriarch of the Lin Family. It can be considered a keepsake of the Patriarch and passed down through generations.

As Lin Ming spoke, the Lin Family descendants stared at the puppets with curiosity and horror. Corpsemancer was a bloodthirsty individual that loved death and chaos. These puppets had mostly been crafted from the corpses of top masters, and their skin and bones were tempered by sacrifices. These 18 puppets had crossed through oceans of blood, and the killing intent they exuded was nearly thick enough to condense into reality. If a mortal looked at them for too long, their souls would be damaged.

“Don’t look at them,” Lin Ming calmly said. He sent out an energy wave that completely isolated the killing intent emanating from the puppets.

The mortal Lin Family descendants were all lost in a stupor until Lin Ming sealed off the puppets’ killing intent. Their consciousness slowly returned, and a cold sweat began to ooze off their bodies. If just looking at these inactive puppets could do this to them, then it was hard to imagine how powerful they would be once activated!

Lin Ming flicked his fingers and 18 gray balls of energy shot into the 18 puppets; this was the compressed Heavenly Demon Force Field. He said, “Any one of these 18 puppets can easily sweep away the Seven Profound Valleys. If the 18 of them join forces, their power will increase a hundred times over. It will be enough to protect the Lin Family and guarantee your safety.”

“Sweep, sweep away the Seven Profound Valleys? 18 join forces, their power will increase a hundred times over?”

Lin Wanshan’s eyes widened as he heard Lin Ming’s words. Although he knew Lin Ming had reached a boundary that none of them were able to comprehend, the Seven Profound Valleys was still a heaven-like existence to the mortals of the Sky Fortune Kingdom. Even the Emperor wasn’t able to defy them, and the Seven Profound Valleys could even remove the Emperor if they wished. If that wasn’t heaven, then what was?

And such a heaven could be easily swept away by a single puppet. The psychological impact to Lin Wanshan could be imagined!

Lin Ming said, “That’s right. But the true essence I left behind in this jade slip is only enough to activate these puppets two times. Once they have been activated two times and the true essence is exhausted, the force field I left within the puppets will swallow them up and reduce them to dust. This is also to prevent other sects from coveting these puppets and bringing trouble to the Lin Family.”

“Only two times…” As Lin Wanshan heard these words, he thought it was somewhat a pity. It was obvious that Lin Ming had the ability to activate these puppets many more times, but he simply didn’t want to do that. For him to destroy these puppets after they were used, proved that these puppets weren’t worth anything to Lin Ming.

Lin Ming continued, “Two times is the limit. This is to prevent the descendants of the family clan to use these puppets to wage war with the world, recklessly plundering other lands and committing evil.”

“For a large family clan to rely on external forces to establish itself, that will make the family clan’s foundation shaky and able to fall apart in a single night. Placing a limit of two times is so that the family clan will only use them in periods of great calamity. If the Lin Family wishes to develop, then they must rely on their own foundations. As for what possible calamities may come your way, that will likely only happen when the switching of dynasties occurs, and that is only something that happens every several hundred years. These 18 puppets will guarantee the Lin Family a thousand years of prosperity. That alone should be enough.”

Chapter 924(B) – Settling the Cycle of Karma

…

…

…

As Lin Ming spoke, Lin Wanshan could only nod.

Lin Ming saw Lin Wanshan’s disappointment that these 18 puppets would be destroyed after they were used twice, but he wasn’t surprised. After all, a Patriarch of a mortal family had a single most important goal, and that was ensuring the prosperity of his descendants. How could his heart not ache upon learning that such divine objects that could protect his family clan would disappear after being used? It was just that with Lin Ming’s status, there was nothing he could say.

Lin Ming shook his head and said, “Even if these 18 puppets I leave behind can be used permanently, it still won’t be enough for the Lin Family to remain prosperous forever. Instead, it might cause the Lin Family’s might to rise as fast as a bubble, and also blow up as fast as a bubble. A hundred year dynasty, a thousand year sect, and a 10,000 year Holy Land; who doesn’t want to enjoy glory and prosperity forever? I also want the Lin Family to develop into a superpower that can live on for tens of thousands of years. But the Lin Family doesn’t have the foundation to do so, nor does it have the destiny. If the Lin Family is one day beaten into the sands of time and lost to the world, that is merely the cycle of samsara at work. It’s to be mourned, but it isn’t a bad thing.”

Lin Ming said these words to Lin Wanshan, but also to himself. A Holy Land like the Silent Demon Emperor City existed for only 3 to 4 thousand years, and even a Divine Kingdom would one day topple to the ground and be forgotten. The boundless universe was endless and infinite, but it was not eternal. This was the law of the Heavenly Dao.

A martial artist that chased after the peak of martial arts and wanted to live on forever in the world was defying the will of the heavens!

To step on this road meant to encounter countless dangers. Without a great destiny and valorous perseverance, one would never succeed.

Lin Wanshan knew that what Lin Ming said was the truth, and he had no words to refute him. If a small and weak family clan held a great power in their hands, that would only end in their own suffering and doom.

“Very well. After today’s matters, this can be considered as having settled the karma between me and the Lin Family. Once I leave this world, the prosperity and decline of the Lin Family will all depend on your own samsara and destiny. If you wish to resist samsara, you can only step onto the road of martial arts and resist destiny. If one day such a person were to appear within the Lin Family again, then that would be the Lin Family’s good fortune.”

If a martial artist wished to ensure that their conscience and heart were complete, then they couldn’t entangle themselves in cause and effect. They had to straighten out their karma in the world; it was impossible to cut it off.

Lin Ming’s karmic ties to this world were two. First was the Lin Family Clan, and second was Qin Xingxuan, Mu Qianyu, and his parents.

Lin Ming didn’t plan to receive the Lin Family Clan into the Divine Phoenix Clan. In the end, the Lin Family Clan was only a mortal family clan; they had very few martial talents. Even if Lin Ming were to bring them to Divine Phoenix Island, it still wouldn’t result in their family clan developing further. Rather, it would only burden Divine Phoenix Island.

If so, then it was better to let the Lin Family Clan stay in the mortal world. They could be kings, emperors, and rulers. They could achieve the ultimate glory and wealth possible to mortals.

As for Divine Phoenix Island, Mu Qianyu, Qin Xingxuan, and the others, that was another matter.

After all of this was finished, Lin Ming turned to Lan Yunyue and said, “Yunyue, come with me.”

Lin Ming moved towards the Hidden Smoke Pavilion. Lan Yunyue hesitated for a moment but silently followed him from behind. As she looked at Lin Ming’s tall and broad back, she felt a hundred different complex emotions swell up in her heart. In these last ten years, Lan Yunyue had regretted what she had done. But as her personality and mind gradually matured with adulthood, she began to see things differently, and she began to understand many things.

What was not hers was ultimately not hers. Perhaps the path she had chosen was also long ago decided by the hands of fate.

Lin Ming was a dragon amongst men, but she was not a phoenix amongst women. The great gulf that existed between them would only grow larger and larger. In other words, even if she didn’t betray Li Ming in the past, it was impossible for them to grow old together until both of them had heads full of white hair. Since this was their fate, perhaps giving all of this up was a good deed instead.

Within the luxurious and jade-inlaid Hidden Smoke Pavilion, Lin Ming randomly gestured to a chair in front. Lan Yunyue cautiously sat down in the center, her figure only occupying a third of the seat.

Lin Ming said, “Yunyue, if you never left me, then perhaps I would’ve had different experiences, and the scene now would’ve been different.”

Lin Ming obtained the Magic Cube in the kitchen of the Great Clarity Pavilion as he was deboning a gold-backed pangolin; it had come from the beast’s stomach. The reason that Lin Ming had gone to Great Clarity Pavilion was because Zhu Yan’s friend had forced him to lose his lodgings.

All of this had been set in motion by Lan Yunyue leaving Lin Ming.

Lan Yunyue gently shook her head, “Fate has no ifs or whats. These years, I believe more and more that heaven has arranged our paths for us. I’ve become used to this simple and plain life, and as I grow, I’ve learnt to slowly endure the sins brought about by the vanity and impulsiveness of my youth.”

Lan Yunyue’s voice was soft. She smoothed the hair that fell down her shoulders. Her face was still beautiful and her temperament was still pleasant and charming. Unexpectedly, there was even a faint taste of innocence to her, as if she were someone that had returned to their true state.

After ten years of trials and tribulations, as Lin Ming finally saw Lan Yunyue again, he couldn’t help but acknowledge that even though she was a mortal woman, she had an inherent beauty and elegance contained in her temperament and experience. She was like a thick, enthralling novel, leaving behind an emotional aftertaste to all who read her.

“You’re right. Fate has no ifs or whats, but that doesn’t mean that destiny cannot be changed. The past me also followed the flow of fate, but the current me has enough strength and destiny to resist that river of fate and defy the will of the heavens.

When one had a great destiny and lived the life of an Emperor, they would be able to resist fate and survive, turning bad luck into good fortune. As for this destiny, part of it was bestowed by the heavens, and another part of it was accumulated through the trials he went through. Even in the mortal world, there were similar views. For instance, the mortal who had a ‘tough life’ and wouldn’t die, the number one scholar who could divine the stars, or even historical figures that were True Dragons and sons of heaven, with the life of an emperor.

In mortal history, these so-called kings and emperors would often encounter many instances of assassination in their lives. But they would manage to avoid death every time. This was a result of their destiny. There was nearly never a case of a fierce and valiant hero who stole the hearts of the world that would be assassinated before they achieved their ambitions.

As Lin Ming spoke, he held onto Lin Yunyue’s sleeve that held her cut off hand. She was shocked and instinctively pulled back, not wanting to show off such a horrifying sight to Lin Ming. But her sleeve was tightly caught by him.

The originally slender and beautiful fingers had all been cut off, making one’s heart fill with incomparably pain. Lin Ming remained silent and began to slowly urge his energy into her body. Lan Yunyue felt a sudden flow of heat enter her, spreading through all her meridians, her limbs, her bones, and making her feel extremely comfortable.

Quickly, Lan Yunyue felt her body become increasingly hot. She began to fragrantly sweat from all over and before long her clothes were soaked wet. Faint traces of gray material came out with this sweat; these were the impurities within Lan Yunyue.

Lin Ming used his own true essence to help Lan Yunyue cleanse her being and wash her marrows. The reason he was able to do so was because after crossing Life Destruction and forming a complete spirit body, his understandings into the structures and principles of the human body had risen to a new level. If someone were to do this rashly, they would only end up ruining the other person’s meridians. After all, a mortal’s body was exceedingly fragile.

This process continued for a full hour. Lin Ming patiently and gently combed through every inch of Lan Yunyue’s meridians. At the end, her complexion was bright red and her chest was heaving up and down.

“Good,” Lin Ming said. He released another burst of energy that eliminated Lan Yunyue’s fatigue.

Lan Yunyue was surprised to find that she could clearly feel the flow of energy within her meridians. She had a faint feeling that as long as she wished to, she could clearly see throughout her own body.

“This is the Pulse Condensation realm?”

Lan Yunyue’s cultivation was only at the Altering Muscle stage. In the martial world, those that entered into the Xiantian realm would condense pre-natal energy within their bodies, returning to a fetus-like state where they breathed in energy and remained free from the pollution of the world. This could be called the time when one truly became a martial cultivator. Below the Xiantian realm, they wouldn’t be able to clear the impurities from their bodies, and remain only a mortal.

“This isn’t the Pulse Condensation realm.” Lin Ming shook his head, “Although I can help you directly increase your cultivation, that’ll only ruin your mentality and drive. It’ll affect your future progress. Now I have rid all of the postnatal air from your body, and transformed the meridians and cells of your body with energy. You shouldn’t have any problems in cultivating to the Xiantian realm.”

“Moreover, here is a pill that can help you regenerate your arm and extend your life by several hundred years. In the future I’ll also grant you further resources. If you cultivate diligently, you should be able to break into the Revolving Core realm, and live a thousand or even two thousand years. That is the limit of what I’m be able to help you to. To arrive at Life Destruction may be far too difficult for you.”

As Lin Ming spoke, he took out a medicinal pill from a jade bottle and slipped it between Lan Yunyue’s lips. He whispered, “Swallow this after chewing. This pill has mild aftereffects and shouldn’t bring you any harm.

Lan Yunyue tightened her lips and stared at Lin Ming as if she were in a daze. There was an unreadable emotion that played across her face. Eventually, she began to carefully chew the pill.

The pill was bitter. It was bitter like the last 10 years of life she had lived. As Lan Yunyue looked at the young man in front of her who was once her boyfriend, she couldn’t stop tears from forming at the corners of her eyes. She began to silently cry.

By meeting Lin Ming, she had made far too many mistakes and lost far too many things, but she had also obtained many things. He was a memory that she would never be able to forget, a figure that was eternally etched into her heart.

Lin Ming smiled, his gaze gentle and charming. He reached out a hand and wiped away her tears. “I’ll bring you somewhere. In the future, you can cultivate there. One day, I’ll leave this world, but that doesn’t mean that this will be our final farewell. If there is a chance, then I’ll return once more and we’ll walk with each other once more.”

Everything that Lin Ming did now was to resolve the worries he had left on this planet, and to prepare himself to ascend into the Divine Realm.

Although he didn’t know what Yang Yun’s plan was, the only thing he didn’t doubt was that the battle between them was inevitable.

And at this time, millions of miles away, Yang Yun was sitting cross-legged atop a mound of rocks. All around him was a bright sea of crimson red blood. Countless skeletons floated in this sea of blood. Some of these skeletons were jet black, hard like divine iron, and some resembled dark red blood, with an infernal energy that pierced through the heavens. There were even some that were crystal clear like jade, sending out a faint heavenly energy.

Without a doubt, these skeletons were all Supreme Elders during their lifetime. They were far stronger than Yang Laotian and Ouye Hua, and even far stronger than the Eightfall Thunder Emperor that had died in the 8000 Mile Black Swamp!

These skeletons were all from characters that had lived 100,000 years ago. They had once been Divine Realm powerhouses!

Waves of blood beat against the stone, causing it to splash into the air. In the far off horizon, a blue light shot towards this place. This light was a bronze ghost coffin, and atop of this coffin was a demon youth. That youth was Whitedemon.

“Demon Lord, why did you summon me back? Has something happened?” Whitedemon fell onto a rock opposite of Yang Yun and bowed in respect.

Chapter 925 – Merciless Indifference

…

…

…

In the span of three years, Yang Yun’s looks hadn’t changed but his temperament was completely different. The past Yang Yun had white clothes that fluttered in the wind and his temperament was ethereal, as if he were untainted by the world. His words were elegant and he was extraordinarily handsome. To describe him with a term would be: a jade-like gentleman.

The current Yang Yun was completely different. There was no longer even the slightest shadow of his past self in his current incarnation. He wore a long crimson robe, and most of his clothes were pulled wide open, revealing powerful shoulders and a defined chest that surged with vitality. His muscles were aesthetic and beautifully cut as if they were formed from jade, crystalline and without flaw.

There was a red line that slashed down between his eyebrows, with two sharp points and a round center, looking like an eye. It lent him a devilish charm.

Such a transformation was because Yang Yun was approaching the demonic path. A martial artists aura was in the end the energy field that surrounded them. Those that studied orthodox cultivation methods would have an energy field that veered towards the correct path, and those that studied demonic path cultivation methods had temperaments that tended to seem demonic, their auras seemingly more demonic and bloody.

Originally, with Yang Yun’s methods and outstanding talents, everyone believed that he would become a great leader and hero of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom. No one imagined that after the trip into the Temple of Marvels, such an unbelievable series of events would follow. Yang Yun had actually slain his own great grandfather and even forced his father into a dead end.

Afterwards, not only did Yang Yun take control of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom, but he also established dominance over the other three Divine Kingdoms. The world was already under his control. If he managed to fuse the four Divine Kingdoms together, he would establish a true sixth-grade sect!

A fifth-grade sect took Life Destruction powerhouses as Elders, and if they had a Divine Sea leader then they would be called a Holy Land. A sixth-grade sect took Divine Sea powerhouses as Elders, and the highest under the heavens as their leader. For the last 100,000 years, there had been 10 people that appeared in the martial world that qualified as the highest under the heavens, but the number of sixth-grade sects did not surpass three!

Every time a sixth-grade sect appeared, that was the gathering of the entire continent’s strength, a brief moment of flourishing history!

If Yang Yun managed to join the four Divine Kingdoms together, he could complete this great goal.

At this time, Yang Yun’s eyes were closed and his face expressionless. He exuded a forceful and compelling momentum from his body, making him feel unapproachable.

“Demon Lord, why have you summoned me back?”

Whitedemon fell onto one knee. The one he was kneeling to was the Ancient Devil within Yang Yun’s body. For these past three years, more and more of the Ancient Devil’s personality and past appearance began to reappear in Yang Yun. In the battle within the Temple of Marvels, the Ancient Devil had lost two-thirds of his soul. But for these last three years, the Ancient Devil had been restoring and nourishing himself in this blood pond. He collected the countless skeletons of Supreme Elders that had died in the great war 100,000 years ago, gathering them together to absorb their energy. The current Ancient Devil had already restored his combat strength to a certain degree. If he were to possess Yang Yun now, his strength would even surpass Whitedemon. Whitedemon became increasingly respectful towards him.

“You cannot defeat Lin Ming.”

The Ancient Devil said. Although he hadn’t seen the great battle between Whitedemon and Lin Ming, he had been able to draw sufficient conclusions from the incomplete information Whitedemon had sent him.

Whitedemon didn’t seem too convinced, but he couldn’t help but acknowledge, “I don’t know where, but Lin Ming has managed to inherit some extremely powerful force field. If I’m not wrong, then it should be part of the Primordius martial intent that Empyrean Primordius wielded in the past. Once this strange martial intent activates, it’ll form a mystical space around him, covering the world in a range of 1300 miles and all Laws and energy lose their effectiveness within. With a long distance attack, my lance light weakens to less than 30% of its original strength after piercing through to the center. But if I were to enter that strange space and fight him, that instead causes all of the true essence in my body to be suppressed by the undeniable principles within; there simply wasn’t anything I could do against Lin Ming.”

“If it weren’t for that strange space, I would’ve been able to kill him in three moves!” Whitedemon said with resentful bitterness. When he fought against Lin Ming, it made him feel like he had strength that he couldn’t use; it was an extremely vexing feeling.

“Mm? Primordius martial intent!” The Ancient Devil’s eyes suddenly shot open and his expression changed. As someone who participated in the great war 100,000 years ago, he had personally witnessed the scene of Empyrean Primordius activate his Primordius martial intent and instantly exterminating tens of thousands of Divine Realm powerhouses where they stood. The Ancient Devil naturally knew just what these words meant!

He pondered over this for fifteen minutes and said, “I’ve looked up Lin Ming’s life history. Before he was 15 years old, his talent was average and his achievements common. But after he reached 15 years of age, his growth became out of control. In just 10 short years, he grew to such a degree already. It’s obvious that 10 years ago he managed to encounter some heaven-defying lucky chance. And I suspect that this lucky chance has some relation with Empyrean Primordius.”

“Could that black vortex within Lin Ming’s body be the elementary form of the Primordius martial intent?”

The Ancient Devil muttered to himself. He had only seen the Primordius martial intent; he had no understandings of it. It was impossible for the likes of him to speculate on existences at the boundary of Empyrean Primordius.

As for the Magic Cube, the Ancient Devil simply didn’t know about this. He had no idea that Lin Ming would have such an fortuitous encounter at 15 years of age, so he came to such a misunderstanding.

As Whitedemon saw the Ancient Devil deep in thought, he brown-nosed and said, “No matter what lucky chance Lin Ming had, after killing him all of that will belong to Sir Demon Lord. Everything he has done or achieved is just a gift for you!”

As Whitedemon spoke to here, the Ancient Devil started to laugh out loud. “You’re right. After some more time passes, my Great Blood Refining Art will reach large success. At that time I’ll kill Lin Ming and obtain all of the secrets on his body as well as all of the destiny that he’s accumulated!”

Whitedemon glanced over the surrounding blood pond and said, “Since the last time I was here, 20% of the blood pond’s power has been absorbed by you. If this continues, will it be enough for you to reach perfection in your Great Blood Refining Art?”

Blood essence was highly nourishing to the divine soul. When the Ancient Devil killed Yang Laotian and Ouye Hua, he had done so to lay dominance over the four Divine Kingdoms but also for their blood essence.

In these past three years, the Ancient Devil gathered the deep sea clans of the Fog Sea and ordered them to slay countless deep sea vicious beasts, using their blood to complete this blood pond. The Ancient Devil had collected the remains of some powerhouses from the Sea of Miracles and tossed their skeletons into the blood pond. All of these were conditions he prepared to cultivate the Great Blood Refining Art.

“That’s right. The grade of these deep sea vicious beasts isn’t high enough. Although there are many high level vicious beasts in the sea, those Divine Sea rank vicious beasts normally stay far off in 500,000 feet water depths. Even I would find it hard to withstand the pressure at such depths, much less kill them. As for the remains of these Divine Realm powerhouses, although they used to be fierce existences, after 100,000 years have passed, their blood has nearly all dried up and they don’t have much effect.”

The Ancient Devil shook his head as he spoke.

Whitedemon’s thoughts stirred. “Is the reason that Sir Demon Lord called me back so hastily that he wishes for me to kill some deep sea vicious beasts to help your supernatural powers reach large success?”

The Ancient Devil nodded. “Indeed, what I need now is fresh blood essence. It’s unlikely that you’ll be able to kill Divine Sea rank deep sea vicious beasts. Currently my supernatural powers are just short of reaching completion. The blood essence of basic vicious beasts is no longer useful to me.”

“Then what should we do? Although human Divine Sea powerhouses are easy to kill, they focus on their dantian, and the power of their blood is far inferior to a complete vicious beast.” Whitedemon said with a thoughtful expression.

At this moment, the Ancient Devil’s lips curved up into a sly smile. “Human blood naturally has a limited effect, but if they have the blood of different beasts within their bodies, then that is a different matter. For instance, the Ancient Phoenix Clan bloodline or the Hydra Clan bloodline are both excellent bloodlines.”

“Mm?” Whitedemon’s eyes widened and a chill crawled up his back. He had the Hydra bloodline!

Woosh!

The surrounding world suddenly changed. A deep blood red barrier rose up, covering Whitedemon and the Ancient Devil inside!

This was the Spectral Blood Skylock Array!

This was far different from the Spectral Blood Skylock Array that had been set for Lin Ming. This Spectral Blood Skylock Array was personally controlled by the Ancient Devil and also had the massive blood pond as support. There was no comparison in the strength between the two. Even Lin Ming would be hard pressed to break through if he personally came here. Moreover, Whitedemon’s ability to break through array formations was far inferior to Lin Ming’s!

“Demon Lord, you, you…!” Whitedemon looked at the Ancient Devil with a disbelieving incredulity etched onto his face. As a subordinate to the Ancient Devil, he owed a great debt of gratitude to him. The reason that Whitedemon was able to cultivate to such an extent was all because the Ancient Devil had provided him with sufficient resources. For all these years he maintained utter loyalty to the Ancient Devil. He never thought that one day he would be the one taken as a sacrifice.

“If you look for vicious beasts, their blood won’t be enough. Lin Ming’s growth is too fast and I don’t have much time left; I’m only a step away from completion. I need your bloodline as the last finishing touch. You currently have a late Divine Sea cultivation, and in the past you even reached the higher Divine Transformation realm. Your Hydra bloodline is just what I need. All I can do is take your minor sacrifice to realize my great plans.”

The Ancient Devil had no expression on his face nor did his voice have any emotion.

Whitedemon’s eyes turned blood red. He grasped his purple spear, feeling as if a knife had been twisted into his heart. He never imagined that one day the benefactor he respected so much would betray him in such a manner.

“Sir Demon Lord, I don’t believe this. In the Sea of Miracles your physical body was destroyed and your strength greatly reduced. Without a mortal body you didn’t have any combat strength at all. If it weren’t for my shelter and support, you would never have been able to live until now. We spent over 100,000 years in the Sea of Miracles together, and yet you are doing this to me?”

The Ancient Devil indifferently looked at Whitedemon. “There is no more meaning in mentioning matters that have already passed. You cannot resist me. 100,000 years ago when I trained you, I already placed a spell in your body. With this big array here as support, killing you is as simple as turning my hand.”

“I don’t believe this! I won’t believe this!” Whitedemon’s eyes blazed as he stared into the Ancient Devil’s eyes. Suddenly, his mind shook as he became aware of what was happening. “You-you are not the Demon Lord! You are Yang Yun! Where is the Demon Lord!? Sir Demon Lord! Sir Demon Lord! Save me! Yang Yun wishes to kill me!”

No matter how much Whitedemon shouted, the young man in front of him maintained his cold apathy, as if everything happening was within his plans and under his control.

“To think that you would recognize me at the end. Correct, I am not the Demon lord, I am me, I am Yang Yun!” Yang Yun stood up, looking over Whitedemon as a divine god oversees mortals, a merciless indifference in his eyes.

Chapter 926 – The End of Whitedemon

…

…

…

“Impossible, impossible!” Whitedemon’s mental state became extremely unstable, “You sealed away the Demon Lord? How can you have the power!?”

“There is nothing that’s impossible. Whitedemon, go in peace and follow your master!” Yang Yun’s hands grasped the void, and the blood pool around him suddenly soared up into the sky, turning into a massive python.

“You damned beast! You ungrateful little bastard! If it weren’t for us, you would’ve already died unknown and forgotten. How could you have such strength to stand at the peak of this continent!” Whitedemon hysterically shouted. His eyes were blood red; he wished that he could tear Yang Yun to pieces.

“Ungrateful?” Yang Yun sneered, “You think I’m a little child who’ll be fooled by such meaningless words? Between you two and I, we’ve already been mutually using each other. I’ve never trusted you, and you’ve never trusted me. If I didn’t act against your master, then once that devil’s supernatural powers reached large success, I would’ve already become a sacrifice or had my body stolen away.

Yang Yun pulled out a bright crimson treasure sword from his spatial ring. This sword had also been refined within the blood pond, and its power was incomparable to the past.

He stroked the flat blade of the sword, and left a touch of fresh blood on the edge. The sword blade absorbed the blood, becoming increasingly beguiling and bewitching!

“Demon Lord! Demon Lord! Have you been sealed away!? Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!”

Whitedemon revolved all of the energy within his body and poured it into his voice, forming a sonic boom that shot towards Yang Yun like landslides and tsunamis.

This was one of the Hydra Clan’s unique sonic energy martial skills, called the Heaven Devouring Roar. He poured his energy into a sound wave to attack the enemy which was extremely effective towards the intangible and invisible divine soul. Whitedemon wanted to use this sort of impact to awaken the Ancient Devil.

Yang Yun remained unmoved. He coldly said, “There is no need to shout. Most of your Lord’s strength was swallowed up by Lin Ming in the Temple of Marvels, and now his strength has sharply dropped. At that time, I bided my time, saved my strength, and while he was recovering from his wounds, I suppressed him in a single go and swallowed him up. For these past few years, the Demon Lord that you’ve been bowing to is me, Yang Yun. Even if you shout until your throat tears apart, he still won’t awaken.”

“What!?” Whitedemon found this unbelievable. He crazily shouted, “Without erasing the spirit mark, you’ll lose yourself if you swallow the souls of others! How is this possible!? How is this possible!?”

“You’re right. I was unable to erase that devil’s spirit mark and could only seal him away. Even so, I will frequently lose my personality and my memories will become muddled. Sometimes I don’t even know who I am anymore. Everything that happens, I rely on my own willpower to withstand and overcome. In the future, once my cultivation rises further and my understanding of the soul increases, I’ll completely eat up that devil’s soul and cancel his spirit mark along with all his memories.”

A soul was composed of memories and a spirit mark; both were inseparable from each other. If Lin Ming wished to thoroughly erase the Ancient Devil’s spirit mark, he also had to destroy the associated memories. But by that time, the Ancient Devil’s memories would also become useless to Yang Yun.

Whitedemon’s heart chilled as he heard this. This Yang Yun was simply a madman, a madman!

Although Yang Yun seemed to casually say all of this, the truth was that this method was the same as suicide. No one was willing to take their own soul as a joke, and rely upon some so-called willpower to overcome the extremely dangerous loss of personality and individuality. Once they failed to do so, they would become insane, falling into depravity and becoming a lunatic with no sense of self.

As for Yang Yun relying on enhancing his boundary in the future and then eliminating the devil’s spirit mark, that was far too difficult. Once memories were fused together, wanting to separate them was easier said than done. If he made a single misstep in the process, he could possibly erase his own memories.

The reason Yang Yun chose such a dangerous path was because he truly did need the Ancient Devil’s knowledge. When the Ancient Devil tried to possess Lin Ming and suffered a near fatal backlash, he had lost most of his soul. But the part that was left behind was the essence of the Ancient Devil’s soul and the source of his memories; it was even more important than the other two parts combined. This was also a reasonable matter. In the dangers of possessing someone, the Ancient Devil would naturally save the most important part of his soul as a contingency.

Yang Yun’s ambitions were great. He wanted to become an unrivalled powerhouse and climb to the peak of all martial arts. He didn’t want to be stopped at the Sky Spill Continent. So to do this, he had to take the risk.

“Madman, you are an absolute madman!”

Whitedemon’s complexion paled. Facing this maniacal Yang Yun, he felt nothing but fear.

Those that didn’t fear a strong opponent, feared those that didn’t care for their life. Those that didn’t fear those that didn’t care for their lives, feared those that were demented. In Whitedemon’s eyes, this Yang Yun was a demented madman.

He was ruthless to his enemies and even more ruthless to himself!

From the start they underestimated Yang Yun and chosen the wrong person. They had raised a tiger, creating this disaster, and making all of their efforts a gift for someone else!

Bang!

Thousands of blood waves shot up into the sky, twisting together into the giant blood python that fell towards Whitedemon. Yang Yun soared high into the skies, seeming as if he controlled this world. “You’re truly a faithful dog. Now, show me your final worth!”

At this moment, words were useless; there was only battle. Whitedemon gave a loud shout and a massive hydra phantom appeared behind him. He grasped his purple lance and shot towards Yang Yun!

“Hydra bloodline, Broken Star!”

As Yang Yun saw Whitedemon strike out with his strongest attack, a trace of pity appeared in his eyes. He casually formed a seal and sent it flying towards Whitedemon. Whitedemon’s body shook, and the hydra behind him suddenly vanished, all of the condensed true essence dissipating into thin air!

“What?” Whitedemon was shocked. He glared at Yang Yun with hatred blazing in his eyes, “You despicable scum!”

He wished that he could devour Yang Yun, but an irresistible energy was suppressing him, giving him no chance to defy. At the same time, the rivers of blood in the air that formed a python fell down and swallowed him. Energy violently exploded and a massive wave of blood shot into the sky, forming endless clouds of blood. Finally, all of it rained down.

Over 30% of Whitedemon’s meridians shattered. He floated face up in a sea of blood, his face pale and fading.

His nose and ears were leaking blood, and his eyes were filled with wavering despair.

Whitedemon smiled. It was pitiful and wretched. “Demon Lord, you didn’t trust me, in the end you didn’t trust me! In the Sea of Miracles I was loyal and devoted to you for 100,000 years, and yet you still didn’t lift the binding spell in my body. Now, that choice will take my life today. It’ll take my life!”

Yang Yun glanced at Whitedemon without sympathy. He hadn’t used any martial skill just now. All he had done was use his great strength to activate the spell that the Ancient Devil had left within Whitedemon.

This was the safest and also cruelest method to defeat Whitedemon. There was not even a chance for him to desperately struggle. To a martial artist, this was the saddest way to die. They possessed supernatural powers, had unwavering confidence in their strength, and yet they didn’t even have a chance to fight for their life.

“In the battle with Lin Ming, you consumed far too much energy and you rushed all the way here without giving yourself a chance to restore your strength. All of that led to you not having any chance to resist this spell.”

Yang Yun’s words were ruthless and indifferent. “Before you die, I would like to advise you one last time. In this world, the only one you can trust is yourself. Your lord was not mistaken. The only reason he would be defeated by me, is because his destiny is lacking and he was severely wounded by Lin Ming. But as for you, you died in a far too stupid manner.”

Yang Yun lifted his right hand and grasped the void. An arrow of blood pierced through Whitedemon’s chest and then flew up high into the sky!

All of Whitedemon’s blood essence began to be attracted by an invisible force, streaming out from his body. It condensed in the air, forming a blood red light that constantly sparkled, incomparably brilliant.

Whitedemon watched helplessly as all his blood essence left through his heart and formed a beautiful yet strange scene in the air. The corners of his lips curved up in an ironic smile. He never thought that his end would come like this.

Blood continued flowing out from Whitedemon’s body. The Hydra bloodline was extremely tough. In addition, Whitedemon had once reached the Divine Transformation realm that existed above the Divine Sea, making his physical body that much tougher. Even though his heart was ruined and his blood essence sucked out from his body, he still didn’t die. Instead, his body withered as more and more blood was pumped out of his body.

Finally, all of Whitedemon’s blood essence and vitality were completely sucked out by Yang Yun!

Yang Yun shot seals of energy into that mass of blood. Faintly, a blood-soaked phantom hydra appeared in that mass of blood; it was the last struggles of the blood essence and vitality.

“The blood vitality actually formed a true shape. Whitedemon’s blood essence quality is indeed wonderful.” Yang Yun murmured. His hand movements became faster; he wanted to refine the blood vitality form.

There were many times when a precious pill was formed and produced a phantom form after leaving the furnace. This was because the medicinal energy was too rich. After a long period of time, it might even develop its own intelligence. Heavenly materials that existed for a long period of time would also possess a medicine spirit; this was the same concept.

Although the blood vitality phantom form was from forming a spirit, it didn’t have any intelligence, merely survival instincts. As it was covered by Yang Yun’s blood energy and began to be slowly refined, it crazily struggled.

However, it was ultimately impossible to resist Yang Yun’s strength. All of its spiritual energy was sucked out and it began to slowly sag down.

“Fuse!”

Yang Yun clutched his hands together and the phantom hydra blood vitality was eventually absorbed by the mass of blood essence, becoming one and turning into a thumb-sized blood pill.

“With this blood pill, this blood pond will become a blood spring; that is a qualitative leap upwards. It will finally allow me to achieve perfection in my Great Blood refining Art. So long as my Great Blood Refining Art reaches perfection, I’ll be able to rely on an array formation and sense a person’s blood vitality, locking onto them in a range of one million miles.”

“When that time comes, Lin Ming, there will be no place left for you to run to!”

“You have the life of an Emperor, and your destiny rises like a rainbow. As for me, although I have gathered and accumulated my own destiny for 40 years, my destiny is still inferior to yours, and even your life is tougher than mine. If I fight you, even if I’m stronger than you, I still don’t have too great of an assurance to defeat you. But even so, our battle cannot be avoided. I tried to kill you, I had the entire world hunt you, and I even harmed your family; our enmity will never be resolved. Just the destiny and secrets that you possess leave me with no choice but to slay you!”

Yang Yun’s ambitions and heart were higher than the heavens, but his true life and talent were worthless. The reason he could obtain his current achievements was because he relied on the Ancient Devil’s resources and teachings. In the Divine Realm, although the Ancient Devil could be considered having some ability, he wasn’t an overlord, much less a great figure. Even if Yang Yun swallowed his memories and reached his boundary in the future, it would be exceedingly hard, nearly impossible to rise any more. He had to inherit another destiny. This destiny would come from Lin Ming.

Since ancient time, if a genius didn’t experience lucky chances, they would never have great achievements. But all lucky chances came from betting one’s life and struggling until the end. Now, with such an extraordinary and singular lucky chance placed in front of him, even though Yang Yun knew that there was danger, he still had to stake his life on it!

Chapter 927 – Once Again Battling the Purple Lion Thunder Source

…

…

…

15 days later, 8000 Mile Black Swamp.

As the Sky Spill Continents true life forbidden zone, the 8000 Mile Black Swamp was permanently covered in dark gray clouds. Here existed dangers upon dangers. If a Life Destruction powerhouse entered, survival would be perilous with nine chance of death and only one hope of life. Even a weak Divine Sea powerhouse could perish here if their luck was lacking.

At this time, a black-clothed youth appeared in the skies above the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. He carried a thick saber in his hands, and his appearance was plain and normal. He looked like someone that could be easily lost within a crowd.

This person was Lin Ming. After he used his appearance changing technique. After forcing Whitedemon back, Lin Ming had rushed to the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. Because he had to pass through a number of transmission arrays to arrive here, he chose to use an appearance changing technique in order to avoid any unnecessary troubles.

He didn’t go to see Mu Qianyu and Qin Xingxuan first. The Giant Leviathan had swam far too deep in the South Sea and was still a long distance away. Moreover, there weren’t any transmission arrays in the deep sea lands. Even if Lin Ming flew at full speed towards the Giant Leviathan, it would still take him a very long time. Lin Ming couldn’t afford the time it would take him to do that. According to Situ Yaoxi’s memories, he had at most one year before he had to fight Yang Yun. The battle was inevitable.

He was now overflowing with spirit medicines, and his cultivation was also quickly approaching a bottleneck. If he had enough time and was able to single mindedly go into seclusion, he would be able to cross more stages of Life Destruction, finally emerging at the sixth or seventh stage of Life Destruction.

Unfortunately, he only had a single year. He had to make full use of this year, thus he came to the 8000 Mile Black Swamp for a single objective. That was the Purple Lion Thunder Source!

When Lin Ming was at the late Revolving Core realm, he had entered the skies above the 8000 Mile Black Swamp and encountered the Purple Lion Thunder Source. Let alone swallowing it, Lin Ming had almost been the one devoured by it instead. If it weren’t for the frightening deterrence of the Heretical God Sprout and Argent White Sword, he might’ve really died in the Nine Heavens Thunder Dominion.

“It should be here.”

Lin Ming followed the route in his memories and arrived underneath the area of the Eightfall Thunder Emperor’s cave dwelling. He looked upwards at the sky.

“Are you sure?” Demonshine asked.

“About 70%,” Lin Ming responded, not daring to have absolute certainty. The space and time within the 8000 Mile Black Swamp was in disarray. Even though Lin Ming had greatly progressed in the Concepts of Space and Time, he couldn’t guarantee that he could find the same location he reached in the past.

Lin Ming suppressed the aura of the Heretical God Sprout and shot into the skies. He broke into a sea of thunder. Countless bolts of lightning flashed in the sky, and arcs of electricity swept through the skies. To the current Lin Ming, this sort of endless thunder was like a mortal bathing in warm water. Not only did he not feel discomfort, but it was rather comfortable and enjoyable.

10 miles, 20 miles, 30 miles.

Lin Ming passed straight into the Thunder Dominion. The color of thunder constantly changed around him, and also increased in strength. However, Lin Ming seemed unaware of this all.

70 miles, 80 miles, all the way to the 90 mile range of the Thunder Dominion!

Here, not only did the color of thunder change, but even its shape changed.

The past thunder came in the form of arcs, but the current power of thunder here was fantastical sheets of glimmering light. Purple white, deep purple, golden red, all of it linked into a single endless stretch of thunder that continued on forever without the slightest sound. It looked like a multi-colored mist, a colorful land where immortals dwelled.

Beneath this tranquil fa?ade, there was actually a terrifying killing intent hiding. The golden red lightning here had been used by Lin Ming to break through to the first stage of Life Destruction. If enough of this golden red lightning was gathered, even a Divine Sea powerhouse would be struck to death.

When Lin Ming’s cultivation was at the late Revolving Core, he had been forced to stop here, unable to go any further in. But now, even this fierce and violet golden red lightning was not a threat to Lin Ming.

Continue upwards!

The 100 mile range Thunder Dominion!

In the past, although Lin Ming hadn’t dared to step into the 100 mile Thunder Dominion, he had still released a wisp of his perception to investigate the area. The 100 mile Thunder Dominion and the 90 mile Thunder Dominion were two completely different realities.

There were numerous large and small thunderballs up here, each of them floating around light stars in the sky. A horrifying power of thunder formed a force field that wrapped around them. The space near these thunderballs was already twisted to shreds, and countless space cracks blanketed the area. Regardless whether space or energy, both were unstable, and even the power of Laws was affected.

If the 90 mile Thunder Dominion was a land where a Divine Sea powerhouse who studied thunder-attribute cultivation could possibly survive, then the 100 mile Thunder Dominion was a true absolute life forbidden zone. All who entered here were doomed to die!

Even Lin Ming had to be extremely cautious after reaching the 100 mile Thunder Dominion. He didn’t dare to rush in. Instead, he used his perception to investigate the area.

“I wonder just how these islands were formed.”

The skies of the 100 mile Thunder Dominion were completely different, as if this was an entirely different world altogether. Many islands of various sizes floated in the sky, and each of these islands held a magnetic god tree!

These magnetic god trees safely coexisted with the thunderballs that floated in the air. Some of them even had roots that extended into these thunderballs, absorbing their energy.

Each and every one of these magnetic god trees were undoubtedly precious treasures! It was just that the last time Lin Ming had come here, he couldn’t even approach them, much less move them.

“A magnetic god tree itself contains a terrifying attack power, and it is also incomparably durable. Cutting them wouldn’t be easy at all. Even if the current me wants to investigate these god trees, that is also very dangerous.”

Lin Ming thought for a moment. Then, his thoughts suddenly stirred and a smile curved up his lips.

“You’ve come? There is no need to hide, I’ve already sensed you!”

Lin Ming’s eyes locked onto a direction. Several breaths of time later, the lightning there began to waver like ripples in the water, forming into countless threads of lightning that gathered together, finally forming into a small purple lion.

This lion was only three feet long, and after forming itself, it looked no different from a real lion. It’s body was robust and powerful, and its purple mane was glorious and magnificent. Every hair strand was clearly differentiated, and its amber eyes were bright and watery. It didn’t seem as if it were formed from the power of thunder, but rather from a genuine lion.

This was the Purple Lion Thunder Source!

Thunder Source – the source of thunder. It was an existence a step above a Thunder Soul. The lowest level Thunder Source was at least 10 times more terrifying than a Thunder Soul.

The Purple Lion Thunder Source already had an inkling of spiritual intelligence. In truth it had discovered Lin Ming from the very start. This was because some of its energy emitted from Lin Ming’s body. That was the energy of the Twinlife Thunder Crystal!

Hundreds of millions of years ago, the Twinlife Thunder Crystal and the Purple Lion Thunder Source were born together. They were from the same body, so the Purple Lion Thunder Source could certainly feel its presence.

The Twinlife Thunder Crystal was involved with the evolution of the Purple Lion Thunder Soul. But such an important object had actually been stolen away by this young man in front of it; how could it not hate Lin Ming to the bones?

It was only that it could feel Lin Ming’s great strength. This young man was already incomparable to several years ago. This caused it to feel a great deal of fear and was also the reason why it didn’t immediately appear. Rather, it remained hidden, secretly observing him.

Even though Lin Ming was strong, it was impossible for the Purple Lion Thunder Source to give up on the Twinlife Thunder Crystal. It prepared to desperately gamble on a battle and waited for a chance to launch a sneak attack. But it had been discovered by Lin Ming.

“Your intelligence isn’t too bad. Your Twinlife Thunder Crystal has already been absorbed by me. If you want to take it back, your only choice is to devour me.” Lin Ming extracted a purple long spear as he spoke.

This was a weapon that Jiang Ziji had left in the palace within the Extreme Violet Ring. It was a high-grade heaven-step thunder-attribute long spear. It was nothing to someone like Jiang Ziji, but to Lin Ming now, it was actually extremely convenient. To deal with the intangible Purple Lion Thunder Source, the heavy and cumbersome Great Desolate Blood Halberd wasn’t the best choice to do so. Instead, the blood and death energy on the Great Desolate Blood Halberd might be restrained by the power of thunder instead.

The best weapon for this situation was undoubtedly this purple spear.

“Submit to me, and travel the world with me. I’ll allow you to evolve!” Lin Ming pointed his spear towards the Purple Lion Thunder Source. An invisible force field erupted from his body. Before now, he had been deliberately suppressing the Heretical God Sprout’s aura; he was afraid he would startle the Purple Lion Thunder Source and cause it to be too afraid to approach him. Now, he no longer needed to do that.

The Heretical God Seed was dual-attribute thunder and fire transcendent divine might. With the full eruption of the Heretical God Seed’s aura, it immediately created an immense pressure on the Purple Lion Thunder Source!

This was a feeling of awe and dread that swelled up within the Purple Lion Thunder Source, which seemed as if it had already been etched into its soul from the very time it was born all those hundreds of millions of years ago. It was a feeling that it could never erase.

In that moment, a trace of fear and alarm flashed in the Purple Lion Thunder Source’s eyes. But it immediately forced out all those emotions, replacing them with a burning anger!

As a Thunder Source, it was extremely arrogant and haughty; how could it be willing to surrender to a human and be used however which way?

Roarr!

The Purple Lion Thunder Source emitted a heaven-shaking roar, bringing with it the glory of the world. All lightning in the 90 mile Thunder Dominion, the purple white, the purple gold, and the golden red, all of it was swept up into a massive multicolored vortex!

If several dozen arcs of this golden red lightning gathered together, it’d be enough to threaten the life of a Divine Sea powerhouse. With so much power of thunder gathered here together, the might could be imagined!

A brilliant fighting intent sizzled in Lin Ming’s eyes. This Purple Lion Thunder Source could obtain increased power from the surroundings in the Nine Heavens Thunder Dominion. As it desperately went all out, its strength was terrifying. If Lin Ming wanted to absorb this Thunder Source, he would need to be exceedingly careful. Otherwise there was a chance he would suffer a backlash and burn away all his meridians, dying in the process.

With the support of the massive amount of thunder energy within the Nine Heavens Thunder Dominion, The Purple Lion Thunder Source’s suddenly expanded to a horrifying degree. Its eyes flashed with a bloodthirsty light. It was certainly afraid of the power and pressure from Lin Ming’s Heretical God Seed, but it also desired to possess this power. If it could swallow Lin Ming, its evolution would reach new heights.

As these thoughts appeared in the Purple Lion Thunder Source’s mind, it began to react in a crazed and excited manner.

Chi-la!

The lightning behind the Purple Lion Thunder source twisted into colorful lightning dragons that shot towards Lin Ming. The five colored lightning dragons emitted whistling cries, their howls echoing between the heavens and earth like rolling thunder claps, piercing straight through the world!

Lin Ming’s eyes were icy cold. He revolved his true essence to the limit and poured his grandmist battle spirit into his purple long spear, thrusting straight towards the light dragons.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

Purple golden thunder surged; even the misty light within the Thunder Dominion was split apart. Lin Ming’s grandmist battle spirit directly bore the attacks of the five colored lightning dragons, withstanding the baptism of thunder. But not only did the grandmist battle spirit not weaken, it instead became increasingly strong.

Heavenly Demon martial intent – grandmist space!

As the lightning dragons roared, an enchanting red lotus slowly bloomed behind Lin Ming. An invisible force field surged outwards, bringing with it an ancient and boundless atmosphere. In an instant, the Nine Heavens Thunder Dominion was enshrouded by the grandmist space.

The grandmist space was able to smother out nearly all energies and power of Laws. Thunder belonged to the class of the five main elements. The power of thunder was born after chaos and was exactly one of the Laws that was suppressed by the grandmist space!

Chapter 928 – Swallowing the Thunder Source

…

…

…

The grandmist space was broad and vast, extending outwards for over a thousand miles. As the Purple Lion Thunder Source was covered in the grandmist space, it suddenly felt its connection to the power of thunder in the world cut off, greatly startling it.

“Law of Annihilation, Chain of Stars!”

Lin Ming suddenly shook his long spear and the power of space erupted. A strong destruction twist force dispersed, combining with the elementary grandmist energy and spinning itself into a chaos storm. The lightning dragons sent out by the Purple Lion Thunder Source were all swallowed up!

With the choking power of the chaos storm combined together with the suppression of Thunder Laws from the grandmist space, the lightning dragons shattered like glass in just several breaths of time!

After the lightning dragons shattered, they turned into a pure power of thunder. Lin Ming swept out his purple long spear, swallowing up all of the power of thunder like a thirsty whale.

As the Purple Lion Thunder Source saw a massive amount of its own energies being sucked up by Lin Ming, it flew into a violent rage.

Roar!!!

With a loud cry, it shot towards Lin Ming!

A Thunder Source was the origin of thunder that was produced over hundreds of millions of years; it symbolized the greatest power of thunder. As it threw its body towards Lin Ming, even the grandmist space around it began to tremble.

“You’re truly worthy of being a Thunder Source. But the more powerful you are, only means the greater the power you bring to me will be!”

A flash of excitement shone in Lin Ming’s eyes. He raised his long spear and lashed it out like a whip. As the spear came smashing down, it contained the compressed energy of the Heretical God Sprout as well as the grandmist battle spirit. If someone who just entered the late Divine Sea were to withstand this strike, they would be greatly wounded and even their dantian might shatter.

Although the inherent energy within the Purple Lion Thunder source was potent, it didn’t have the ability or knowledge of cultivation methods. Even though it held so much energy within itself, it was actually unable to display its full potential.

Lin Ming didn’t fear the current Purple Lion Thunder Source’s main form. What he feared was what would happen after swallowing it, and the terrifying impact to his meridians that the terrifying energy would cause. If his control was lacking in the slightest, all of his meridians would burn to a crisp.

Woosh!

The spear came slashing down like a purple arc of light, nearly splitting the void in half. But the Purple Lion Thunder Source suddenly vanished in that moment!

A series of purple phantoms appeared in the void like an ethereal dream. Thunder was the fastest of the main elements, and this Purple Lion Thunder Source also had an intangible body. It’s speed was nearly unrivalled!

“You want to compare speed? I also have faith in my own speed!”

Lin Ming coldly smiled. The Gate of Wonder opened and it merged with the Mystic Lightning Shade and Golden Roc Shattering the Void. His body became a blur, splitting into countless fading lights that nearly filled the entire grandmist space!

“Chasing Thunder!”

While using his extreme speed, Lin Ming also poured the power of thunder from the Heretical God Sprout into his purple spear and thrust outwards!

The attack power of Chasing Thunder wasn’t too high. But just in terms of being a Concept based martial skill, it was able to reach the limit of speed.

To deal with the intangible Purple Lion Thunder Source, he didn’t need an extremely powerful attack. In fact, all he needed was a Thunder Law martial skill attack to damage the Purple Lion Thunder Source to an even greater extent.

With so many movement techniques combined with Chasing Thunder, he overtook the Purple Lion Thunder Source in the blink of an eye!

As the Purple Lion Thunder Source saw Lin Ming catch up, its eyes filled with an incredulous disbelief. The reason that it dared to attempt ambushing Lin Ming was mainly because it had to retake the Twinlife Thunder Crystal within Lin Ming’s body, and secondly because it believed its own speed was extraordinary and abnormal. It believed that no matter what happened, it could freely come and go as it pleased. It never imagined that Lin Ming’s speed would actually surpass its own.

The Purple Lion Thunder Source finally began to feel fear!

Bang!

Lin Ming’s spear struck the Purple Lion Thunder Source!

Lin Ming didn’t feel as if he stabbed into a body, but a violent energy still surged into his meridians, wanting to burn his body.

This was the energy of the Purple Lion Thunder Source causing a backlash. If a normal Divine Sea powerhouse were to have such a brutal thunder energy enter their bodies, they would be severely wounded.

But this wasn’t anything much to Lin Ming. His thoughts touched upon the Heretical God Sprout as he revolved the energy in his body, instantly sweeping away the violent thunder energy within him. As for his meridians, his own body had already been tempered by thunder, so he didn’t receive any damage at all.

The Purple Lion Thunder Source was in a miserable state. After its stomach was pierced through by Lin Ming’s spear, its main form had been shaken by the power of Laws within Lin Ming’s Chasing Thunder, causing a massive portion of its energy to disperse. In this grandmist space, not only was it unable to supplement itself with energy from the Thunder Dominion, but instead it had to constantly consume energy. Its body suddenly turned much less ethereal and illusory, and its shining eyes began to dim down. If the Purple Lion Thunder Source had resembled a real lion in the past, the current Purple Lion Thunder Source seemed like a reflection in the water blurry and unclear.

“It’s injured. Take this chance to cage it.” Demonshine’s voice sounded out from Lin Ming’s spiritual sea. Without needing Demonshine’s advice, Lin Ming already shot out eight gray marks of energy that turned into thunder symbols and flew into the Purple Lion Thunder Source’s body.

This was the Concept of Thunder that Lin Ming had perceived through Jiang Ziji’s jade slips. The 12 lighting symbols that comprised the Mystic Lightning Shade were also based off a similar principle. But those 12 lighting symbols revolved the power of thunder to stimulate the potential of the body, whereas these eight thunder symbols utilized the power of thunder to display a sealing effect.

As these lighting symbols flew into the Purple Lion Thunder Source, the Purple Lion Thunder Source felt as if a saber had been thrust into its body, it’s strength rapidly reducing. It desperately roared out, wanting to use energy to break off all eight of the thunder symbols, but these thunder symbols were like barbed shackles that chained it down. They deeply dug themselves into its body. The more the Purple Lion Thunder Source struggled, the more pain it felt!

“Awoo! Awoo!”

The Purple Lion Thunder Source sent out pitiful cries!

Lin Ming didn’t give it the chance to recover. He stepped on Golden Roc Shattering the Void, flashing through space and appeared right above the Purple Lion Thunder Source.

Both of Lin Ming’s hands grasped the purple long spear. An endless amount of thunder energy swelled into the spear as he brought it crashing down!

Puff!

The long spear nearly split the Purple Lion Thunder Source in half!

The fading Purple Lion Thunder was simply unable to dodge. Disregarding the pain that wracked its body, it cried out again and again, its roars shaking the heavens and earth. It wanted to shake loose these thunder symbol shackles, but at this moment, it suddenly felt as if it had lost control of all the energy in its body, all of that energy was being rapidly sucked out via Lin Ming’s spear.

In just several blinks of an eye, the Purple Lion Thunder Source’s body lost its luster, nearly turning transparent.

It’s roars were also feeble, lacking the strength hey had before. The eight thunder symbols in its body were like shackles of divine iron, not even allowing it to move in the slightest.

The current Purple Lion Thunder Source could not ascend into heaven nor escape into the earth; there was no path left for it to go. The grandmist space blockade also cut off all of its energy supply. Finally, the Purple Lion Thunder Source was overcome by despair.

It howled again and again, begging for mercy, but Lin Ming ignored its cries and continued to draw out the energy from its body.

“Yield to me, otherwise I will destroy your spiritual wisdom and only absorb the source of your energy. Although this is a bit less effective to me, the different won’t be too great! Moreover, if I wipe out your spiritual wisdom and only absorb your energy, the energy would also be much easier for me to control! There are plenty of benefits to doing so!”

Lin Ming’s face was mercilessly indifferent and the energy in his hands became increasingly strong. The Purple Lion Thunder Source didn’t doubt that at the moment it refused, Lin Ming would really wipe out its spiritual wisdom!

After a brief moment of hesitation, the Purple Lion Thunder Source finally showed a begging expression. It issued a series of purring ‘awoo awoo’ cries as its body shrank, finally submitting itself to Lin Ming.

“Hehe, if you take in this fellow without wiping out its spiritual wisdom, it’ll be a bit dangerous. If there is ever a day you are seriously wounded, this fellow might take that chance to revolt.” Demonshine said. He wasn’t too approving of Lin Ming’s methods.

Lin Ming had also thought of this point. He said, “If I erase its spiritual wisdom, that’ll be the same as erasing the most essential part of the Thunder Source. Not only will its strength be reduced, but attacks using it will lack that spiritual sense, and it won’t be able to evolve in the future either.”

“Moreover, what is more important is that if it submits to me without resistance, it’ll be much easier for me to absorb. If I try to absorb such a violent Thunder source now, that doesn’t have any spiritual wisdom, my meridians might not be able to withstand the immense pressure. I have no idea whether or not I would be successful.”

Lin Ming didn’t fear that the Purple Lion Thunder Source would betray him in the future. With his rate of growth, his strength would soon far surpass the Purple Lion Thunder source. And there was also the suppression of the Heretical God Sprout. Once the Purple Lion Thunder source entered the Heretical God Sprout, its energy would come under the control of the transcendent divine might. Wasn’t betraying him easier said than done?

“Come in!”

Lin Ming grasped out his hand and directly grabbed the tiny Purple Lion Thunder Source in his hand. In that moment, an energy vortex formed in Lin Ming’s hand. All of the thunder origin energy that comprised the Purple Lion Thunder Source’s body was continuously absorbed by this vortex, constantly flowing into the Heretical God Sprout, vitalizing the Heretical God Sprout’s leaves and roots.

The Purple Lion Thunder Source didn’t dare to resist. It allowed Lin Ming to draw out all of its energy. At that time, it would only be able to retain its own spiritual wisdom, and most of its energy would be under Lin Ming’s control.

As Lin Ming absorbed it, the Purple Lion Thunder Source became increasingly small. Finally, it shrank to a size even smaller than Lin Ming’s palm before it was also sucked into the vortex.

Like this, it traveled through Lin Ming’s meridians until it reached his dantian. There it saw the Heretical God Sprout.

The sprout didn’t contain too formidable a thunder energy; it was only a third of the Purple Lion Thunder Source’s prime condition. However, the energy it contained was extremely pure and moreover exuded a faint aura of the Great Dao Laws, causing it to feel fear and alarm as it approached.

Compared to this Heretical God Sprout, all of the essence of thunder that it had ever absorbed in the past was nothing at all; they were on two completely different levels!

After discovering this, the Purple Lion Thunder Source no longer held any resistance to being absorbed by the Heretical God Sprout. The key point was that it wasn’t able to resist.

It obediently allowed itself to be absorbed by the Heretical God Sprout, completely fusing into the branches and leaves. At that moment, the Heretical God Sprout also began to gently wiggle around. A young leaf began to bud out from the crown of the sprout, slowly unfurling out from a curled form. The veins of the leaf became gradually clear. This leaf had an incomparably strange appearance. It resembled a small furnace, and on the surface of this furnace was the design of a purple lion.

Chapter 929 – To Another Level

…

…

…

“The Heretical God Sprout grew.”

Lin Ming was overjoyed as he saw the Heretical God Sprout that had grown by an inch. He could clearly feel that the Heretical God Sprout’s strength increased by a great deal. This would help him to perceive the Concepts of Thunder and Fire to an even higher degree in the future. It was as if there was some divine power assisting him. After he ascended to the Divine Realm, chances were likely that he would join the Ancient Phoenix Clan and receive the direction of Fairy Feng. At that time, with the support of the Heretical God Sprout, his strength would surely rapidly rise.

After the Purple Lion Thunder Source was completely absorbed, lightning began to twinkle above the Heretical God Sprout. Lin Ming closed his eyes and sensed within himself, nodding with satisfaction. The Heretical God Sprout’s control of energy was far better than what he had imagined. After the Purple Lion Thunder Source entered the Heretical God Sprout, most of its energy was absorbed by the Heretical God Sprout and the control of that energy also fell into Lin Ming’s hands.

If the Purple Lion Thunder Source’s spiritual wisdom was a general, then the energy of its body was the army. But now, all military power was held by Lin Ming.

This feeling of controlling all was very gratifying. As Lin Ming’s strength grew, the chances of the Purple Lion Thunder Source betraying him would also become increasingly low.

“Demonshine, after absorbing the Purple Lion Thunder Source, I feel as if my entire body is flooded with energy. Breaking through to the fifth stage of Life Destruction shouldn’t be difficult!”

“You want to break through to the fifth stage of Life Destruction? You haven’t even entered the fourth stage of Life Destruction for a full year, and you want to break through to the fifth stage? Your cultivation has been far too fast recently. If you don’t suppress this speed it’ll cause your foundation to be shakier and make it harder for you to advance in the future.”

A general Emperor level talent would step into Life Destruction at 50 years of age. From that point on, they would pass a stage of Life Destruction every 7-8 years, finally reaching a maximum of six or seven stages.

But for Lin Ming, he nearly crossed a stage of Life Destruction every year. In less than five years he had crossed four stages of Life Destruction and was about to cross the fifth.

Lin Ming’s cultivation had risen too quickly, and more importantly, for these last five years, Lin Ming hadn’t experienced true combat too much. Without tempering himself in the fires of the battlefield, this would cause his comprehension of Laws and martial skills to be flawed and imperfect, resulting in further instability within his foundation.

Lin Ming said, “I know, but I can still make up for it in the future. As long as I break through to the Divine Sea realm and calmly cultivate, I’ll be able to calm down and solidify my energy. Although it will be a great deal of work, I’ll face Yang Yun soon and I must increase my strength as much as possible before then. A year from now, Yang Yun’s strength will absolutely surpass Whitedemon’s. With my current cultivation, even if I absorb the Purple Lion Thunder Source, I don’t think I’ll be able to defeat him.”

“Indeed. Yang Yun is proficient in the Concept of Time. If he changes the flow of time and seals himself up within a space, he might be able to train for ten years in this one year. I fear he might even break into the middle Divine Sea.”

Demonshine said with a bit of worry. Eight stages of Life Destruction, breaking into the middle Divine Sea, as well as Yang Yun’s cultivation methods not being too bad to begin with, if all of these factors were combined together then Lin Ming truly was in a dangerous position.

“Yang Yun can indeed change the flow of time, but to change the flow of time in an enchantment requires a martial artist to constantly revolve the power of Laws to maintain it. If he wishes to put forth his full heart and effort, completely investing in cultivating his supernatural powers, it’s actually difficult to maintain the change in time flow to a 10 to 1 degree.”

A martial artist had to wholeheartedly devote their attention to cultivating. The reason that Lin Ming’s ethereal martial intent was so amazing was because it allowed him to eliminate all distractions from his mind.

The best condition for cultivation was to remain in a selfless state, free of all distractions. To cultivate in such a manner and also maintain the enchantment was extremely difficult. When Old Man Good Fortune had done so in the past, it was because he had reached a bottleneck in his cultivation for thousands of years already. The so-called closed door seclusion was actually sitting in meditation, self-cultivation his soul, becoming aware of the Laws, and tempering his will. It was incomparable to what Yang Yun needed to do.

In order to cultivate in a 10:1 time flow enchantment, he would have to have another powerhouse devote themselves to maintaining the revolution of Laws. This was the only way in which he would be able to completely invest himself in cultivating. But wasn’t it easier said than done to find a powerhouse like that, who would also serve him for so many years?

In truth, Lin Ming could accomplish his. With his current understandings into the Concept of Time, he could also achieve this point to a degree. Although he couldn’t change the flow of time to a 10:1 ratio, 5:1 or even 6:1 wasn’t a problem.

Lin Ming received the grandmist space and flew straight to the cave dwelling that the Eightfall Thunder Emperor had opened in the past.

This cave dwelling was located on one of the floating islands. But, this floating island was actually not located in the 100 mile Thunder Dominion, but within the 90 mile Thunder Dominion.

This was the only floating island within the 90 mile Thunder Dominion. As for the islands in the 100 mile Thunder Dominion, even the Eightfall Thunder Emperor didn’t have the ability to approach them.

Lin Ming flew into the Eightfall Thunder Emperor’s cave dwelling. The plain and simple cave revealed an ancient and timeless atmosphere, no different from the last time that Lin Ming was here. The stone tablet within the cave dwelling stood tall, with the same words engraved on it as before.

“If fate will not accommodate my clan, then I shall break the shackles of fate. If the heavens will not accommodate my clan, then I shall go against heaven’s will and cut down all immortals!”

These words contained a thrilling sword intent, causing those who saw it to feel awe in their hearts.

As Lin Ming’s boundary grew, he could increasingly feel just how powerful the Eightfall Thunder Emperor of the past was.

“Since ancient times, several unrivalled powerhouses appeared from the Sky Spill Continent that have been given the highest under the heavens title. Even amongst all of them, the Eightfall Thunder Emperor was outstanding.

The so-called highest under the heavens was someone that had the ability to instantly kill off all other powerhouses from their era. This was not merely defeating them, but killing them.

Before the appearance of Yang Yun and Whitedemon, even Old Man Good Fortune wasn’t able to achieve this degree of strength. This was why he was only considered the quasi strongest under the heavens.

Among the several highest under the heavens that had appeared throughout the years, there existed the strong and the weak amongst them. Whitedemon could only be considered as being on the weaker end.

Lin Ming sucked in a deep breath and sighed, “Even though I absorbed the Purple Lion Thunder Source, I shouldn’t be much stronger than him. Defeating him should be easy, killing him is extremely difficult though. If this were in ancient times, I could only be considered the lowest level of the highest under the heaven individuals within the Sky Spill Continent.”

In terms of pure quantity of peerless powerhouses, the Sky Spill Continent was far inferior to the Holy Demon Continent. Correspondingly, the Holy Demon Continent’s highest under the heavens was much stronger.

And above the Holy Demon Continent, there was also the endless sea that existed around the two continents. That boundless area was over 10 times larger than the Sky Spill Continent and Holy Demon Continent combined! The number of powerhouses that existed there could be imagined.

Even such a vast world was an insignificant speck of sand in the three thousand boundless universes. There were countless worlds and dimensions that were far more powerful than the Sky Spill Continent.

And beyond all of that, there was the far more terrifying Divine Realm!

As Lin Ming thought of this, he deeply felt that the road he walked upon still had a near infinite distance to go. Becoming the highest under the heavens within the Sky Spill Continent wasn’t anything special.

After his battle with Yang Yun, he brought to completion all of his ties to this world. He would ascend into the Divine Realm, stepping onto a wider stage and meet even greater challenges.

Lin Ming set down an array formation in the Eightfall Thunder Emperor’s cave dwelling. With his current understandings into the Concept of Thunder, he was already able to isolate the ruinous lightning from the 90 mile Thunder Dominion.

The 8000 Mile Black Swamp was a land filled with great dangers. There would always be some risks if Lin Ming were to cultivate here. When laying down array formations, he did so diligently and meticulously.

After a full day passed, Lin Ming fused the Laws of the grandmist space into the array formations he recalled from the Ancient Devil’s memories, arranging three layers of great formations. He sat down on the Eightfall Thunder Emperor’s stone bed and took out the 12 thunder dao fruits as well as the 20 top grade spirit essence stones from his spatial ring.

Of these 12 thunder dao fruits, one of them had already been eaten up by Lin Ming, leaving behind only the peel that contained the marks of the mysterious Thunder Concepts. Up until now, Lin Ming hadn’t managed to find the time to thoroughly perceive them.

This time, Lin Ming picked up a thunder dao fruit and used a dagger to slowly peel off the skin near the stalk, revealing a red fruit flesh that glowed a beautiful red.

The fragrance of wine drifted upwards, the aroma sharp and refreshing. It smelled like millennium aged wine, and the highest quality aged wine at that.

“Mm? This thunder dao fruit seems different from the one I ate before. That fruit was cream colored and white, but this one seems bright red like flesh and blood.”

The crystalline fruit flesh actually had bright red vessels that ran through it. The intoxicating aroma assaulted his senses, tantalizing and sweet.

Lin Ming cut off a piece of the fruit with his dagger and gently touched it with his fingers. It was bouncy and thick. He swallowed it down. As the fruit flesh entered his mouth, it melted without him even needing to chew. The fragrance dissipated down his throat, turning into a refreshing energy that filled his limbs, flowing to his heart, his dantian, and his head.

In that moment, Lin Ming felt as if he was drunk. His mind was dizzy and his arms and legs turned soft. All of his bones loosened, as if he would melt to the ground.

The second thunder dao fruit had an effect that was completely different from the first. It caused Lin Ming to feel as if he were floating on clouds; light and satisfied.

“What a strong and strange medicinal efficacy. It seems every thunder dao fruit is different.”

Lin Ming took advantage of the time before the medicinal efficacy of the thunder dao fruit faded and began to revolve a Divine Realm thunder cultivation method that was left behind on one of Jiang Ziji’s jade slips – ‘Thunder Sovereign Edict’. Within Jiang Ziji’s great collection, it was of the few cultivation methods that could be practiced without the Electric Violet Kirin bloodline.

Thunder energy mixed with true essence, circulating around and around again.

Lin Ming hadn’t entered the ethereal martial intent, but although he was half-drunk and half-awake and his mind seemed to be blank, his thoughts were incomparably clear. Although his actions were slow, energy crazily swelled up within his body.

This strange condition was similar to when a mortal martial artist drank wine to utilize the drunken fist. It was a cultivating state that was superior to the ethereal martial intent, similar to being hypnotized. In this state, there was no fear, no astonishment. In this state, one felt as if they had dug out their full potential and that any impossible matter had become possible.

Two hours.

Four hours.

Lin Ming digested the energy from the thunder dao fruit. As he was finished absorbing the energy, he would wake up from that strange state and eat another slice of the thunder dao fruit’s bright red flesh.

This fruit flesh contained an extremely great deal of energy. A normal thunder-attribute martial artist would be able to eat no more than 4, maybe 5 slices, otherwise their bodies would burst apart from all the energy. To eat more, they would have to discharge all the excess energy, but doing so was a complete waste.

Lin Ming didn’t have such a problem. The Heretical God Sprout had risen to another level and it swallowed up all the energy it was offered.

During such a high intensity training period, Lin Ming’s understandings towards the Thunder Laws became increasingly clear. Light shimmered around his body, brilliant and dazzling, as if he were about to turn into an immortal. And behind Lin Ming, dao diagrams began to partially reveal themselves, looming over him. They were abstruse and mystical, etched with lines that seemed to contain the most mysterious Thunder Laws.

Chapter 930 – Dark Clouds

…

…

…

In a great and empty hall, fifteen individuals were sitting around a long table. There were men and women, each one of them had an extremely deep aura; all of them were Divine Sea powerhouses.

Within the Sky Spill Continent, there were just over a hundred Divine Sea powerhouses. For the last several hundred years no Divine Sea powerhouse was born. On the contrary, the old Divine Sea powerhouses began falling from the skies. Now there were only 90 Divine Sea powerhouses left. In this grand hall, one sixth of the remaining Divine Sea powerhouses were gathered.

Sitting around this table, many people had worried and anxious expressions.

“I wonder just what reason this Yang Yun has to have summoned us here today.” At the end of the table, a white-clothed woman was lightly rubbing her forehead, her voice uneasy and filled with doubt.

She was the White Clan’s Fairy Snow Gale.

In these past years, Yang Yun had become increasingly strong. In particular, he managed to unite the deep sea race powerhouses of the Fog Sea under his name, and now there were over 20 Emperor level powerhouses who pledged their lives to him. When this was combined with the deterrence of the two top powerhouses in him and Whitedemon, this made it so that no one dared to resist him.

“No matter what it is, we should just do it and get it over with. We still have Yang Yun’s battle spirit tracing mark on our bodies; we can only erase these marks if the force of our will approaches his. Now, whatever he says is law, how can we possibly defy him?” Beside Fairy Snow Gale, a blue-clothed middle-aged man hesitantly said.

Since ancient times, even if one was the highest under the heavens, they had rarely managed to take complete control of the continent in their hands like Yang Yun. The reason Yang Yun was able to accomplish this was because of his battle spirit. If anyone dared to defy his orders, he would be able to hunt them down across the world.

As the blue-clothed man spoke, silence fell over the hall. After half an incense stick of time passed, another person suddenly whispered, their voice faintly trembling, “For the last year, there have been seven Divine Sea powerhouses that have gone missing. These seven people all have a single common characteristic, and that is that they have a divine body or variation bloodline.”

Just these words caused a chill to creep down everyone’s backs. A divine body, variation bloodline, or variation dantian, all of these belonged to geniuses amongst geniuses. Their cultivation was rapid and their chances of reaching the Divine Sea were much higher than others. So even if there were an exceedingly small number of martial artists that possessed a divine body or variation bloodline, that number wasn’t small within the population of Divine Sea powerhouses. They accounted for around 20% of all Divine Sea powerhouses.

Moreover, these people tended to break into the Divine Sea realm by themselves; their overall strength was greater than others.

In just the last year, seven of these variation bloodline Divine Sea powerhouses had gone missing. That meant that nearly half of them had disappeared!

Of these people, three of them had been determined dead, because their lifesoul jade slip had shattered. The other four didn’t leave behind a jade slip, but they had left behind a message and declared that they had either ‘gone into seclusion’ or were ‘travelling the world to search for immortality’. How could these Divine Sea powerhouses that had lived for thousands of years possibly believe such words?

For this sort of matter to suddenly happen, how could someone not be shocked!

The Divine Sea powerhouse that spoke was only casually thinking of this point; they didn’t speak any further. But all of the present Divine Sea powerhouses were wise people who had each gone through their own trials and tribulations; none of them were idiots.

It was likely that those seven people had all died!

Underneath the heavens, there were only a few who possessed the power to kill seven Divine Sea powerhouses in a year and to leave very few clues as to who had done it.

Whitedemon, Yang Yun, and Old Man Good Fortune qualified to do so.

As for Lin Ming, everyone present thought he was a bit worse than Old Man Good Fortune. No one had seen his battle with Whitedemon. The only ones who had witnessed that battle had been Situ Yaoxi and the several deep sea Emperor powerhouses that had accompanied Whitedemon, and all of them were dead.

Although everyone thought that Lin Ming’s cultivation must have been extraordinary for these past few years, they all thought it was unlikely that his strength would grow to the point of being on par with Whitedemon or Yang Yun.

This wasn’t to say that they underestimated Lin Ming. It was just that three years was truly too short a time and they didn’t know that he had comprehended a transcendent divine might. In truth, if it weren’t for the Heavenly Demon martial intent, Lin Ming really wouldn’t have been Whitedemon’s match.

Of the three people capable of killing seven Divine Sea powerhouses in such a manner, Old Man Good Fortune didn’t have the motive to slaughter them. The most likely culprits were Whitedemon and Yang Yun.

All seven of those Divine Sea powerhouses had a divine body or variation bloodline. This common characteristic resounded in everyone’s minds, making them draw some associations and conclusions. For instance, there were some demonic path cultivation methods that could refine the blood essence of variation bloodlines to vitalize one owns body. Yang Yun’s demonic atmosphere was enough to blot out the sky; it wouldn’t be strange if he used such a cultivation method!

Moreover, he was even willing to slay his own great grandfather. If he could do that, what wouldn’t he do?

As the martial artists present realized this, they all felt like lambs in a pen, waiting to be slaughtered. Especially the Divine Sea powerhouses present that had variation bloodlines; their complexions paled. If Yang Yun wished to kill them, they wouldn’t be able to do anything.

“Do we just sit here and wait for death?” Fairy Snow Gale sent out a true essence sound transmission. She only sent out a sound transmission to those people that she trusted most. Within Yang Yun’s domain, she wouldn’t dare to speak carelessly.

A blue-clothed old man responded, “This child Yang Yun, his ambitions are far too great! He has already started to move against us. Once he has enough strength in the future, I fear he’ll unite the four divine Kingdoms. We must band together to oppose him. If the remaining 90 some Divine Sea powerhouses wholeheartedly join forces, we’ll still be able to resist him!”

“Remaining 90 some Divine Sea powerhouses join forces?” A middle-aged man helplessly shook his head, “That’s easy for you to say. There are likely many of Yang Yun’s spies in the remaining Divine Sea powerhouses, and there is also the Asura Divine Kingdom that has completely surrendered to Yang Yun. To them, a world controlled by Yang Yun is better than one dominated by Lin Ming. Then again, even if we all get together, wanting to defeat top masters like Yang Yun and Whitedemon, and even those Fog Sea powerhouses under him doesn’t seem too possible. If we try that, it’s likely we’ll be instantly killed by Yang Yun instead!”

“Then what do you propose we do? Do you think we should allow Yang Yun to slowly nibble away at our strength until we simply fall apart?”

Everyone fell into silence. They lacked the strength to resist Yang Yun, but if they didn’t resist him, their ultimate fate wasn’t looking too good either.

The Shang Clan Patriarch, Shang Yuetian said, “Yang Yun isn’t without threat. His greatest threat is Lin Ming. In these past years, Yang Yun has put out a world-wide arrest order for Lin Ming but no one has been able to find him. The Sky Spill Continent is incomparably broad. If Lin Ming is wise and finds some place to close up in seclusion and cultivate, then 10 years later he’ll definitely be able to kill Yang Yun. That is our last and only hope.”

“You think that Lin Ming is fine if he goes into hiding and cultivates by himself? Hey, don’t underestimate Yang Yun, his methods aren’t necessarily worse than Lin Ming. I have no idea what he’s been up to these years, but he might be able to sniff out Lin Ming’s location somehow.”

Fairy Snow Gale shook her head and said, “I’m hopeful about Lin Ming. You probably don’t know what happened in the South Horizon Region’s Sky Fortune Kingdom?”

The Sky Fortune Kingdom was only a common and insignificant country within the vast Sky Spill Continent, moreover it was a mortal nation, lacking martial arts inheritances. It could be described as a tiny village in the middle of nowhere to those present. The only reason the powerhouses knew of it was due to Lin Ming.

They had also heard of the trap Yang Yun had arranged at the Sky Fortune Kingdom.

“Mm? What happened?” The Sky Fortune Kingdom was far too distant from the four Divine Kingdoms, and Lin Ming had also killed off almost everyone present at the time. News of the event hadn’t yet spread out. Of course, the Asura Divine Kingdom that had suffered the greatest losses was certainly aware of what happened, but they would never have spread such news outwards.

“All of the Asura Divine Kingdom powerhouses that were stationed at the Sky Fortune Kingdom’s Lin Family, including Situ Yaoxi and the Sun Family Clan Patriarch, all of them have been completely exterminated. Even the Lin Family clansmen and buildings have all been completely swept up by some great supernatural power. Does this help you draw any associations?”

“Mm? Are you saying that the one who did this was Lin Ming? Lin Ming has finally shown himself again!?”

Fairy Snow Gale’s words shocked everyone! Lin Ming had gone missing for over three years, but he had actually reappeared!

Some people were immediately excited. This young man Lin Ming always gave them a pleasant surprise. Now they finally had a chance of toppling Yang Yun!

“It’s only been a bit more than three years, he’s too impatient.” The middle-aged man who had been a bit gloomy shook his head, “And killing Situ Yaoxi and Patriarch Sun isn’t much at all. They are the weakest Emperor level powerhouses that only managed to reach the Divine Sea through lucky chances. Yang Yun and Whitedemon could kill them by lifting their fingers. If Lin Ming were compared to Yang Yun, I’m afraid the difference is still too great.”

“How come you always say such depressing words?” Fairy Snow Gale slightly frowned, “Lin Ming killing Situ Yaoxi and Patriarch Sun indeed isn’t much, but don’t forget, how could Yang Yun not keep some alternative chess pieces within the trap he set at the Sky Fortune Kingdom? Even though Lin Ming knew it was a trap and he didn’t know Yang Yun’s true self was waiting there, he still dared to rush in and save others. He even managed to safely escape! This is enough proof that Lin Ming has confidence he can freely escape from Yang Yun and Whitedemon’s hands. It might even be possible that he fought with Whitedemon. Lin Ming is an unrivalled talent, the likes that we’ve never seen before; it’s impossible to judge his limits with common sense.”

Fairy Snow Gale’s speculations were reasonable. Everyone glanced at each other, a faint ember of hope lighting up in their hearts. With Lin Ming reappearing, they could follow Lin Ming and engage Yang Yun in a final battle.

Of course, the premise of this was that Lin Ming had the ability to frontally contend with Yang Yun. Even if he was weaker, he needed to at least be able to contend with him.

“We just need to endure for a few more years. Once Lin Ming has grown enough, we can join together and counterattack Yang Yun.”

As Fairy Snow Gale spoke, she suddenly felt a powerful aura surge over her. Looking up, she could see a tall young man walking into the grand hall. He wore a red robe and a thin red line cut between his eyebrows. His posture was straight, his looks perfect, his skin as clear as jade, and his demonic temperament incomparable.

This person was Yang Yun!

By just meeting his eyes, Fairy Snow Gale felt as if her own soul had become lost, as if he saw through every inch of her body. She even suspected that he listened in on the true essence sound transmissions she sent out.

“How-how could he have such terrifying power?”

Fairy Snow Gale’s breath was caught in her throat. After not seeing him for over half a year, Yang Yun had become even more unfathomable. It was like he succeeded in practicing some monumentally strong devil arts. The momentum that rolled off of him left her alarmed and horrified!

“Were done for. Yang Yun’s strength has already reached this level, how can anyone still hope to defy him?”

Despair filled Fairy Snow Gale’s heart. It wasn’t just her, everyone else had similar feelings. All of the confidence they had of relying on Lin Ming to bring down Yang Yun came crashing down like an avalanche.”

Chapter 931 – Inescapable Net

…

…

…

“What are you all discussing with true essence sound transmissions?”

Yang Yun asked with a smile as he glanced over everyone. But his smile actually had a faintly eerie taste!

True essence sound transmission?

As everyone heard these words, they felt their palms turn sweaty. At that moment, they even felt as if the contents of their discussion was sensed!

By all reasoning, a true essence sound transmission shouldn’t be discovered by others, so when had Yang Yun realized it? Or had he said these words just to fool them?

Facing this Yang Yun who seemed to be omniscient, all of them felt a pressure, a pressure as heavy as a mountain!

Yang Yun’s eyes flashed like bolts of lightning; no one dared to meet his gaze.

“Fairy Snow, you seem to have something to say to me. If you wish to say it out loud, it doesn’t matter. Your White Clan has followed my Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom for thousands of years already. You can be considered loyal and devoted.”

Yang Yun’s vision fell onto Fairy Snow Gale. Fairy Snow Gale suddenly felt suppressed by a deep aura, as if all of her innermost thoughts and feelings were seen through. This feeling caused her heart to waver and a chill crawled down her back.

However, Fairy Snow Gale was also someone with a strong will and she was a master of her own mood. She took a deep breath, her voice coming out calm and even as she said, “We haven’t been speaking about anything, only waiting here for you.”

“Oh? Is that so?” A smile hung on Yang Yun’s lips; no one could understand just what this smile meant.

Behind Yang Yun, Situ Haotian and the other powerhouses of the Asura Divine Kingdom followed. The Asura Divine Kingdom was already like water and fire with Lin Ming; they were destined to submit themselves to Yang Yun so they could resist Lin Ming.

Several weeks ago during the battle within the Sky Fortune Kingdom, the Asura Divine Kingdom had suffered serious losses. Situ Haotian’s face was dark and dismal as he stood behind Yang Yun. No one knew just what he was thinking at this moment.

Yang Yun calmly arrived at the head seat, flicked his red robe, and sat down. “I have called you all here today so that you could all help me with something.”

As Yang Yun spoke, he flicked his fingers and over a dozen jade slips flew out from his sleeves, each of them landing in the hands of the Divine Sea powerhouses present. “Arrange an array formation according to the description in the jade slip. I have prepared the array flags already. All you have to do is pour your energy within it.”

Everyone took a jade slip, glanced at each other, and then immersed their perception within the jade slip. They discovered that the content of the jade slip was actually a map that encapsulated the entire Sky Spill Continent, as well as the South Sea, Fog Sea, North Sea, and Red Sea and continuing for 60-70 million miles outwards.

Hundreds of red spots dotted the map, and every red spot was connected to other red spots with red lines. Looking at the entire picture, it formed a massive network that covered the entire continent as well as a great portion of the four seas.

“This is a transmission array?”

“Yes, it’s a transmission array, ultra-long distance transmission arrays that have a distance of 8 million miles each. Together they cover the entire continent. You’ll only be responsible for the Sky Spill Continent. As for the four seas, I’ve arranged for others to handle that.”

There were several hundred transmission arrays and they were also placed very far from each other. If Yang Yun personally went to arrange them then, he would have to expend an incalculable amount of time and effort. If he wanted to arrange these arrays in several months, the only way was to use these Divine Sea powerhouses to lay them down separately.

Yang Yun had killed seven variation bloodline Divine Sea powerhouses of the Sky Spill Continent. He drew out all of their blood vitality and mixed them together with Whitedemon’s hydra bloodline, finally completing the last step of his Great Blood Refining Art. Now, as long as he could cultivate for another half year, his cultivation method would reach perfection.

At that time he would be able to use the aura of Lin Ming’s blood vitality and lock down his position within a million mile range. By utilizing these transmission arrays, he would then be able to search the entire continent in a short period of time. There would be nowhere for Lin Ming to hide.

Yang Yun took out a set of array flags and divided them between spatial rings that he then tossed out. He coldly said, “There are a total of 316 transmission arrays. All of you only need to lay down 82 of them. The array discs have already been completed. I will give you two months to finish this simple task. It’s best if all of you be careful and not make a mistake, otherwise I’ll have you all pay the price for it.”

Yang Yun’s voice contained a light killing intent, causing the hearts of everyone present to turn cold. Facing the unfathomable Yang Yun, none of them were able to resist.

Yang Yun turned away and departed, leaving everyone left behind to look at each other in dread and trepidation. As they held the jade slips in their hands they tasted despair on their tongues.

“I have a feeling that all of Yang Yun’s actions this time are aimed at Lin Ming.” Fairy Snow Gale said with a true essence sound transmission.

Humans and animals occasionally developed faint premonitions about the future. This feeling was illusory and difficult to put into words, but often it was quite accurate. Especially to martial artists whose cultivations had reached a certain level, their premonitions tended to be more accurate.

“It is possible that Yang Yun is finally making his move. After staying quiet for nearly 4 years, there is no way he’ll allow Lin Ming to freely develop as he wishes any longer.”

“I have no idea what Yang Yun has done these past years but his strength has soared. Compared to 3-4 years ago, his power seems far deeper. I feel a great pressure pushing me to my limit just by looking at him. How could Lin Ming possibly defeat him?”

“Indeed. Lin Ming simply doesn’t have enough time. If he had five years, no, as long as he had another three years, this would be an entirely different situation.” An old man shook his head, feeling this entire situation unfortunate. Lin Ming’s talent far exceeded Yang Yun’s, but Yang Yun wouldn’t give him the time to grow up.

“There’s nothing we can do. Anyway, we still have to lay down these transmission arrays, otherwise we’ll die even faster.”

A blue-clothed old man said. He took out an array disc and an array flag from a spatial ring. These array flags were carved with countless complex lines and symbols, and there were also special instructions inscribed in the jade slip on how to set it up. After Yang Yun studied the Ancient Devils array formations for all these years and became proficient in the demonic path array formations of the Divine Realm, it was simple for him to set up a transmission array that could span 8 million miles.

At the same time, millions of miles away in the skies above the 8000 Mile Black Swamp, Lin Ming was calmly meditating at the Eightfall Thunder Emperor’s cave dwelling. Arcs of thunder freely crawled around his body, and behind him 12 complex array diagrams appeared. These array diagrams were formed from the Laws of the Great Dao, and there were endless mysteries contained within them.

These array diagrams slowly rotated, slowly fusing into Lin Ming’s body. A hot, burning feeling emitted outwards. His body seemed to become like a sun as his entire body emitted a radiant light.

“This is the aura of the Great Dao Laws. The thunder dao fruits have the tracings of the Great Dao Laws fused into them, and these tracings formed these diagrams. These are also fragments of the Great Dao Laws.”

Lin Ming opened his eyes, seeing everything through a haze of purple. He wasn’t a stranger to this mystical feeling. When he was at Timeworn Phoenix City, he felt something similar when he faced the chaos stones, but the feeling wasn’t as clear as it was today.

“This is truly worthy of being a divine fruit bred from the essence of the heavens and earth. The fruit pulp actually has tracings of the Great Dao integrated into it. If my cultivation was higher, I would’ve experienced even more profound feelings from these tracings.”

Lin Ming mumbled to himself. His body was filled with vitality and overflowed with energy.

He continued to meditate and cultivate, absorbing energy and becoming increasingly aware of the Great Dao Laws. After an unknown period of time, Lin Ming’s body silently collapsed. First it was his skin, then his muscles, then his meridians, all the way down to his bones and organs.

After his physical body broke apart, he turned into an intangible substance.

Without noticing it, the calamity of Lin Ming’s fifth stage of Life Destruction appeared.

Chapter 932 – Postcelestial Dao Diagram

…

…

…

The fifth stage of Life Destruction, shatter and reform the core, carving the form of elementary Laws on the surface of the Revolving Core. As long as one could reach the sixth stage of Life Destruction and thoroughly condense the Laws into their Revolving Core, they could officially cross Life Destruction and attempt to break into the Divine Sea.

The highest levels of Life Destruction were divided into nine stages. The first three stages reformed the spirit body, the second three stages reformed the core, and the last three stages reformed the divine soul.

After crossing six stages of Life Destruction, one could rely on their own strength to reach the Divine Sea. But the last three stages pertained to the future strength of a martial artist and how far they would be able to walk on their path of martial arts. The more formidable a soul was, the more energy it was able to manipulate. The soul was also related to the will; it was the carrier of the battle spirit. If one’s soul wasn’t powerful, their potential was limited.

In the cave dwelling, Lin Ming’s physical body had already become a loose fog of flesh and blood. He was slowly tempering himself in the sea of energy.

One day. Two days. Three days.

After half a month passed, within that blood fog, energy and essence began to gather together, forming a Revolving Core.

The process of forming the Revolving Core was extremely slow. A faint atmosphere of source energy lingered around the Revolving Core, condensing into a dao diagram.

When source energy naturally evolved, it would also naturally form a dao diagram. This was the so-called ‘postcelestial dao diagram’. The postcelestial meant that the dao diagram was naturally formed, whereas precelestial meant that it was man-made.

When source energy formed a postcelestial dao diagram, it would contain the inherent Great Dao of martial arts principles. This was also the so-called natural Laws.

Of the many dao diagrams, the most eye-catching and distinct one was the purple dao diagram. This dao diagram was ten feet wide, and the dao patterns engraved upon it shone like arcs of light, similar to bolts of thunder. The evolution was complex and enigmatic, containing profound mysteries and truths. This was the dao diagram of Thunder Laws. Lin Ming had perceived the thunder-attribute jade slip that Jiang Ziji left behind and had also eaten the thunder dao fruits, grasping all of the Great Dao fragments within the fruits. Out of all the Laws that Lin Ming comprehended, the Thunder Laws were far above all others!

A close second to the thunder dao diagram was a round red dao diagram. This red dao diagram was 8 feet wide, and the traces that throbbed on its surface where like countless beating flames. This was naturally the Fire Laws dao diagram. Lin Ming had the bloodline of the Ancient Phoenix and also trained for a long period of time at Timeworn Phoenix City. He had even meditated on the chaos stones. The fire dao diagram also had unrivalled might.

Following that, the Space Laws and Time Laws dao diagrams were far from being as impeccable as the first two; many of its traces were faint and blurry.

Behind that, there was the Darkness Laws that had just barely managed to form a dao diagram. There were many sections missing.

As for the final Wind Laws and the Concept of Vibration, they didn’t form dao diagrams. They condensed one inch long square symbols that were eclipsed underneath the dazzling radiance of the two great dao diagrams of thunder and fire.

When crossing the fifth stage of Life Destruction, and during the period when the elementary form of Laws were being carved into the surface of the Revolving Core, if dao diagrams were to form at this period, then that was an extreme phenomenon. It represented the peak solidity of foundation and also of great achievements in the future.

In the boundless universe there were countless martial artists. From body transformation to Houtian, Xiantian, Revolving Core, Life Destruction, Divine Sea, and then slowly continuing upwards to Divine Transformation, Divine Lord, Holy Lord, World King, and finally to reach the boundary of Empyrean.

It was unknown how many martial artists had died on the road of martial arts. To nearly all of them, they had taken a World King to be their final goal. Within the 3000 great worlds of the Divine Realm and also including the countless smaller worlds, there were only a total of 3000 World Kings. Moreover, this number was accumulated over several hundreds of thousands of years. To step onto the throne of a World King, one had to encounter many lucky chances. They had to have a great will, great intelligence, a strong heart of martial arts, heaven-defying talent, the direction of skilled masters, and countless resources stacked upon each other. Only when everything came together would one have a small chance of achieving such a boundary.

Lin Ming had now condensed postcelestial dao diagrams at the fifth stage of Life Destruction. Although this didn’t mean that he would become a World King in the future, this was considered a solid step towards reaching the peak of martial arts.

After three days passed, all of the dao diagrams disappeared as they fused into Lin Ming’s Revolving Core crystal nucleus. Lin Ming’s body began to slowly form. First his skeleton, then his muscles, blood vessels, meridians, and finally his skin and his hair.

Lin Ming sat naked on the stone bed, his body glimmering with a bright light. He could feel that the vigor of his essence, energy, and soul had reached an entirely new level. If he were to fight with Whitedemon now, he was confident he could easily defeat him, and perhaps even kill him.

Just as Lin Ming was thinking about what his next step would be, he suddenly heard an earthshaking explosion spread through the nine heavens. Even the island he was on began to tremble because of the sound. The ceiling of the cave began to tremble and release dust and stone powder, as if it would collapse at any time.

“Mm? What’s that?”

Lin Ming was startled. This shouldn’t be a Thunder Source or some other holy object. Just from the momentum and prestige of this sound, if it really were a Thunder Source then it was a Thunder Source on a completely different level from the Purple Lion Thunder Source. There was no way that Lin Ming was a match for it.

After thinking for a moment, Lin Ming decided to carefully hide his energy aura. He quietly creeped towards the cave entrance to see what was happening.

Bang bang bang!

The deafening sound continued. It sounded like chains and rings slapping against each other.

This sound seemed able to rupture the heavens and earth. If an ordinary person were to hear this, even their soul would be shattered.

Lin Ming held his breath and arrived at the cave entrance. He cautiously released his perception to investigate the situation outside. What he saw caused a chill to crawl up his back and into the skies!

Above the nine heavens, there were actually several hundred thick iron chains that formed a massive web, spreading out in all directions. These iron chains were hundreds of feet thick, and each one was covered with dense layers of symbols. The hundreds of chains formed a faint great array that seemed to separate the world. At this moment, this massive network of chains violently trembled, as if some utterly terrifying existence attempted to break free from the bindings of these chains!

Ka ka ka!

The demonic sounds of the chains colliding with each other caused Lin Ming’s mind to shiver. It was like he was listening to the death knell of a grim reaper from the abyss of hell.

He discovered that every iron chain was connected to a floating island. These chains penetrated deep into the mountains on the islands, where they were suppressed by the magnetic god trees.

“Roar!”

The ancient desolate beast that was locked within the great array of chains suddenly emitted a thunderous cry. The terrifying howl shook the world. As Lin Ming heard this sound, he felt all of his blood tumble as his face turned white.

“What a terrifying roar. Could there be a God Beast locked within this array formation?”

Lin Ming remembered the great dragon within the Eternal Demon Abyss that was likely a God Beast. He didn’t doubt that if a normal Divine Sea powerhouse were to face the frontal roar of whatever God Beast this was, their souls would likely be expelled from their body and broken down into nothingness!

Lin Ming wanted to ask Demonshine just what this was, but he sensed that Demonshine had fallen into the very depths of his spiritual sea and remained absolutely quiet there, impossible to wake up no matter who called to him. This sort of invisible and intangible great roar contained an inherent energy that was extremely damaging to the divine soul. Even though Demonshine was hidden within Lin Ming’s body, he still had to completely seal himself off lest he be grievously wounded by this roar!

And at this moment, with the sound of billowing thunder, all of the countless thunder balls that floated around the skies suddenly shot into the magnetic god trees. The several hundred islands and the several hundred magnetic god trees suddenly bloomed with a brilliant purple gold divine light. Vast and endless thunder energy raced down the chains, turning the chains a radiant purple gold.

The roaring God Beast seemed to withstand a brutal pain. It emitted a miserable howl as the power behind its voice weakened. It had obviously been injured by the thunder attack of the array formation.

From the cave dwelling of the Eightfall Thunder Emperor, Lin Ming was able to clearly see everything that happened. Each thunder ball that floated within the 100 mile Thunder Dominion contained an incomparably terrifying power. Even though Lin Ming had reached the fifth stage of Life Destruction and also had a profound understanding of Thunder laws, he still didn’t dare to impulsively enter the 100 mile Thunder Dominion. It could be seen how ghastly these thunder balls were.

But now, the countless thunder balls gathered together to deliver the sealed God Beast a nearly lethal blow. It was hard to imagine just what level of power this attack reached!

It was highly likely that this was the work of an Empyrean level existence!

“So these hundreds of floating immortal islands were only the base of the great chain array, and those magnetic god trees only served as the focal eye to gather all of the energy. A magnetic god tree of this size would be a treasure even within a large sect of the Divine Realm, and yet someone used several hundred of them to seal off this God Beast existence. Could such a bold tactic be the work of Empyrean Primordius?”

“No, that’s wrong. Empyrean Primordius controls the power of chaos. When I passed through the Road of Emperor, I was able to experience the grandmist space that he left behind and even gained a minor understanding towards him. If Empyrean Primordius were the one to arrange this array formation, he should’ve used the power of chaos as the foundation, not these Thunder Laws.”

“Could it be that this is an array formation left behind by Empyrean Primordius’ enemy?”

As Lin Ming became aware of this point, he thought it more and more probable. Empyrean Primordius’ enemy was definitely also an Empyrean. If they were an Empyrean skilled in Thunder Laws, creating such a great array was also reasonable.

But just what did this great array seal off, and for what reason?

Lin Ming’s mind raced with thoughts. At this time, the roars that enveloped the skies begun to fade away. Demonshine’s weak voice resounded in Lin Ming’s mind, “This is incredible, seriously incredible. These chains might possibly be the legendary dragon trapping cables. Every link of the chain has a weight that surpasses the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. A single dragon trapping cable has 1080 links, and there are several hundred dragon trapping cables here. The weight of them all added together surpasses a small meteor. Could there really be a True Dragon trapped within?”

“It might be Empyrean Primordius’ contract beast that is sealed within. Who knows just what’s going on.”

Lin Ming shook his head. Although this was undoubtedly related to Empyrean Primordius, it wasn’t something he could explore with his current boundary.

The God Beast that was locked away in the skies had stopped roaring, and the dragon trapping cables also vanished into thin air, leaving nothing but the hundreds of immortal islands floating around as they had been before. The only difference was that the thunder balls in the air had become 70% smaller.

Lin Ming’s thoughts stirred as he saw this. After a brief moment of hesitation, he slowly and carefully made his way towards the 100 mile Thunder Dominion. With Lin Ming’s strength, he didn’t have the ability to enter the 100 mile Thunder Dominion. But the struggle of the God Beast just now had greatly depleted the energy within the 100 mile Thunder Dominion. The thunder balls had all dimmed down, with less than 30% of their energy reserves remaining.

Perhaps he would be able to absorb some to give Yang Yun a happy surprise?

If he could borrow some of the power of these thunderballs that supported in sealing off a God Beast, just what would it be like if it struck Yang Yun?

Lin Ming was filled with anticipation.

He completely focused his mind on the Heretical God Sprout and slowly approached the 100 mile Thunder Dominion. The barrier between the 90 mile Thunder Dominion and 100 mile Thunder Dominion simply wasn’t able to stop Lin Ming who was skilled in Thunder Laws.

Lin Ming smoothly arrived at a fist-sized thunderball.

Chapter 933 – Lin Ming Returns

…

…

…

The fist-sized thunderball appeared serene and listless. But as Lin Ming approached, he could feel the hairs on his body stand up. The energy within the thunderball was too dense; it had formed an energy field around it.

This energy field actually caused the nearby space to twist together. As Lin Ming closed in, his heartbeat, his breathing, everything got affected by it.

Facing this thunderball which was likely left behind by an Empyrean rank master, Lin Ming didn’t dare to be the least bit sloppy in his actions, even though he had the Heretical God Sprout supporting him.

Although the Heretical God Force was a potent ability, it wasn’t infallible. As for what rank martial arts cultivation method it was, Lin Ming wasn’t sure. But no matter how powerful it was, it shouldn’t surpass a transcendent divine might rank cultivation method.

One could approximate how powerful a transcendent divine might was just from observing the Heavenly Demon martial intent. The Heavenly Demon martial intent was only a Heavenly Demon martial intent, but it was able to instantly kill a Divine Sea powerhouse and allow Lin Ming to jump ranks to battle.

Empyrean rank masters might even possess more than one transcendent divine might. If this thunder ball in front of him was formed by a transcendent divine might rank cultivation method, it’d be difficult for Lin Ming’s not yet fully grown Heretical God Sprout to suppress it.

Lin Ming’s concentration was completely focused on the Heretical God Sprout. He slowly reached his hand out and began to suck out the thunder ball’s energy through his fingertip.

As this small trace of energy entered his body, Lin Ming felt like a steel needle pierced into his body. Wherever this energy went, he felt like his meridians would burst apart at any moment, unable to withstand the burden.

This energy gave of an unbelievably heavy feeling, just like grandmist energy.

Thunder energy that was invisible and intangible could actually give off such a heavy feeling; Lin Ming thought this was incredible.

Looking up at the large and small thunderballs that floated in the sky, Lin Ming thought they looked like stars in space.

“This ancient powerhouse was actually able to transform the power of thunder into state like stars. If it weren’t for that sealed God Beast trying to free itself from its shackles and greatly weakening the energy within these thunderballs, there would have been no way for me to even absorb one.”

The supernatural powers of an Empyrean level character were already far beyond Lin Ming’s imagination. Any great array they casually left behind would contain a heaven-shaking grandeur.

Lin Ming withstood the pain that wracked his meridians and continued to gather the thunder energy, having the Heretical God Sprout freely absorb it.

After absorbing this thunderball, Lin Ming found two similarly sized thunderballs and also absorbed them. Only then was the Heretical God Sprout completely saturated with energy.

Everything was successful. Lin Ming could feel that his own combat strength reached an unprecedented level. He was even looking forward to his battle with Yang Yun so he could test the limits of his own strength!

Lin Ming descended from the Nine Heavens Thunder Dominion, a straight black line that zoomed towards the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. To the current Lin Ming, the dangers of the 8000 Mile Black Swamp weren’t anything much.

After a quarter hour, Lin Ming reached the edge of the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. A flame suddenly lit up in front of him; this was unexpectedly the light of a sound transmitting talisman.

“Sound transmitting talisman? Is it Duanmu Qun? Or the Forsaken god Clan?”

Lin Ming’s eyebrows shot up. Within the entire Sky Spill Continent, the only ones who could find Lin Ming were Duanmu Qun and the others. When Lin Ming met with Duanmu Qun at the Forsaken God Clan, he had left his sound transmission mark at their dimensional realm so that they could contact each other in the future in order to help lead them back to the Holy Demon Continent.

A sound transmission mark could only be used to send a message; it couldn’t be used to lock onto Lin Ming’s position. He had no fear that his sound transmission mark would be revealed to others.

“Only Li Yifeng and a few others know of my relations with Duanmu Qun and the others. Moreover, Duanmu Qun tends to keep a low profile; Yang Yun shouldn’t be targeting them. But the Forsaken God Clan is different. Everyone under the heavens knows that I have significant ties to the Forsaken God Clan. Even so, Yang Yun shouldn’t try to start anything with them.”

By all reasoning, Lin Ming was only a friend to the Forsaken God Clan. Even if Yang Yun wanted to force out Lin Ming, it was meaningless for him to try something with the Forsaken God Clan. But that didn’t guarantee that Yang Yun wouldn’t fall into a demented state and release his anger on the Forsaken God Clan. If that happened, there was no way the Forsaken God Clan would be able to resist him.

After the flame flashed for several breaths of time, it extinguished itself. Lin Ming thought for a moment as he heard the message in the sound transmitting talisman. “Yang Yun is planning on laying down a massive network of transmission arrays through the world to deal with me? And they want me to go to White Cloud Mountain Range to discuss countermeasures with Fairy Snow Gale?”

“Could it be a trap?” Demonshine suddenly asked. “If Yang Yun has taken control of the Forsaken God Clan, then it shouldn’t be difficult to find your sound transmission mark.”

Lin Ming shook his head. “It shouldn’t be. This message should be sent by Duanmu Qun and Feng Shen. In order for me to trust this message, they even added on several matters that occurred in the Eternal Demon Abyss’s 1000 mile forbidden zone. Besides us, no one else should be aware of those matters. It’s unlikely that Duanmu Qun and Feng Shen would be discovered by Yang Yun. And with their personalities, even if Yang Yun caught them, they wouldn’t willingly be controlled by him.”

Demonshine nodded. Indeed, this sounded true. Especially that Feng Shen. He was an indifferent and proud character, and would rather die than be controlled by others.

“It seems like the Forsaken God Clan is safe. Yang Yun hasn’t done anything to them yet.” Lin Ming let out a sigh of relief. If the Forsaken God Clan was exterminated because of him, the guilt would weigh heavily on his heart.

“It might be because of the goddess and Empyrean Primordius. Don’t forget, that devil also comes from the Sea of Miracles, and the Forsaken God Clan is significantly related to Empyrean Primordius and the goddess; they might even be their descendants. The Ancient Devil should also be aware of this. Not just that, but the Forsaken God Clan also has to bear a mysterious bloodline curse. Even if Empyrean Primordius already perished, the Ancient Devil wouldn’t rashly do anything to the Forsaken God Clan. There is always the possibility that he might get himself killed by the curse.”

“Yeah.” Whether it was the Eternal Demon Abyss or Forsaken God Clan, they both had an inexplicable curse placed on them. An Emperor level powerhouse that entered the Blood Slaughter Steppes would also be killed by this curse.

“White Cloud Mountain Range, Fairy Snow Gale, let’s go!”

Lin Ming flew straight towards the White Cloud Mountain Range. The truth was that even if this was Yang Yun’s trap, Lin Ming wouldn’t have been afraid to go. He already knew the level of Yang Yun’s array formations. After he combined the Ancient Devil’s knowledge of demonic path array formations with the knowledge of orthodox array formations he knew, his comprehension of array formations far surpassed Yang Yun’s. Even if Yang Yun laid down an array formation to trap him, Lin Ming had the ability to break through it.

As for a battle, Lin Ming didn’t fear that at all. In fact, he was even anticipating it.

…..

Millions of miles away in a hidden cave dwelling deep within White Cloud Mountain Range, Fairy Snow Gale sat at a jade table, a trace of worry coloring her face.

Beside her was a blue-clothed old man and a white-clothed middle-aged man. They were respectively the Shang Family’s Highest Elder, Shang Yuetian, and the Seven Star Divine Kingdom’s Divine Emperor, Li Yuxiao.

Out of the four Divine Kingdoms, Li Yuxiao was the Divine Emperor with the least achievements. He only ruled for a mere 300 years, and his cultivation wasn’t too extraordinary either; he had barely stepped into the middle Divine Sea realm. Compared to an established, older middle Divine Sea powerhouse like Situ Haotian, his strength fell short. This was also the reason why the Seven Star Divine Kingdom was ranked at the very end of the four Divine Kingdoms.

The most crucial aspect of a Divine Kingdom’s strength was the peak strength of the Divine Kingdom’s highest master. In this aspect, the Seven Star Divine Kingdom was simply unable to compete with the other three Divine Kingdoms.

“In these past 40 days, we’ve split up to dozens of places and sent out over a hundred sound transmitting talismans. Yang Yun only gave us a two month deadline to complete the transmission array network. We only have 20 days left and we still haven’t managed to find Lin Ming.” Shang Yuetian slowly said, his wizened eyes tinged with nervousness.

“The sound transmitting talismans we use can only go 6 million miles at most. If Lin Ming isn’t in the scope of this range, we won’t be able to find him.”

Li Yuxiao sighed. The Sky Spill Continent was simply too vast. With the four great seas also added on, even with Lin Ming’s sound transmission mark and these sound transmitting talismans that had a 6 million mile range, wanting to find him was easier said than done. They couldn’t do as Yang Yun had done and lay down hundreds of ultra-long distance transmission arrays in a single go. Moreover, if Lin Ming was trapped in some great array or mystic realm, it was possible the sound transmitting talisman would be blocked.

“At this point there is no way to reach him. If we cannot find him, then that is our fate and there isn’t anything that can be done.” The Forsaken God Clan Patriarch Shibai said from across Li Yuxiao and Fairy Snow Gale.

Sitting beside Shibai were three people; Duanmu Qun, Feng Shen, and Lan Xin.

There were only 20 days remaining. With every passing day, their hopes of finding Lin Ming became increasingly dim. Producing this sort of ultra-long distance sound transmitting talisman wasn’t easy at all. Even with the Seven Star Divine Kingdom, White Clan, Shang Clan, and many other Holy Land level family clans joining together, they were only able to gather up a hundred some of them. If they wanted to create new sound transmitting talismans, they simply didn’t have enough time to find the raw materials.

If they used up all these sound transmitting talismans, they really had no hope of finding Lin Ming.

Shang Yuetian frowned. “Could it be that Lin Ming doesn’t believe us and thinks this is a trap instead?”

“No.” Feng Shen’s words were as precious as gold. He was confident in his belief.

“I hope that’s true.” Fairy Snow Gale shook her head. Yang Yun’s tracing mark was on her and Shang Yuetian’s body. Although she had used the excuse of arranging a transmission array to come here, she had still taken an enormous risk in doing so. If Yang Yun wasn’t closing up in cultivation and secretly hid himself here to ambush them, there was no way they would be able to sense him with their differences in strength. At that time, the results could be imagined.

As Fairy Snow Gale was lost in worry, her mind suddenly stirred. She could faintly feel the surrounding heaven and earth origin energy restlessly moving as a strong aura suddenly came shrouding down.

“Someone has come!”

Everyone’s hearts tightened. They swept their perception outwards and could actually see a white-clothed young man gracefully passing over the White Cloud Mountain Range. The White Cloud Mountain Range was hundreds of miles long, and Fairy Snow Gale and the others had all chosen an extremely covert location for the cave dwelling. Moreover, there was concealing array formations at the cave entrance. Even so, the white-clothed young man took less than half an incense stick of time to lock in on their position.

This white-clothed youth was naturally Lin Ming.

Lin Ming swept his divine sense outwards. After he couldn’t find any signs of traps or ambushes, he moved directly towards the cave dwelling. To someone like Lin Ming who was proficient in both the demonic and orthodox array formations of the Divine Realm, seeing through this array formation was a simple matter.

“Lin Ming! Lin Ming has come!” Fairy Snow Gale’s eyes lit up, her heart swelling with joy!

“What amazing methods. Such a great White Cloud Mountain Range and there is even a concealing array formation, yet he’s managed to find our positions so soon. The young are truly worthy of respect!” The Seven Star Divine Emperor Li Yuxiao acclaimed. To see Lin Ming was to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just the actions of him discovering their location so easily was enough to startle everyone!

Chapter 934 – Counterattack

…

…

…

Lin Ming fell into the cave dwelling. He was dressed in white and spotless. The clothes he wore were formed from countless threads of thunder twined together, unstained by earthly dust. If the cloth tore in battle, it would automatically repair itself. If given to a mortal, they would be invulnerable to attacks, and these clothes would be a priceless treasure passed down through their family.

The aura exuding from Lin Ming’s body was like the great and vast sea, unfathomable.

“Little Brother Lin, you’ve finally come!” Shibai was filled with emotion upon seeing Lin Ming again after so many years. Lin Ming’s strength had already surpassed his; the speed of his growth was unbelievable!

“Patriarch Shibai!” Lin Ming respectfully bowed in the ceremony of a junior to a senior. He didn’t pull rank just because his strength surpassed Shibai’s. When Lin Ming was younger and far weaker, if it weren’t for the protection of the Forsaken God Clan, there would have been no way he would’ve been able to escape Situ Haotian’s clutches. This was the equivalent of a lifesaving graciousness, something he would never forget in his life.

“Haha, Little Brother Lin doesn’t need to be so polite, I’m not sure I can afford it. We’ve already been waiting for you for quite some time now.” Shibai chuckled in an extremely good mood.

Beside him, Duanmu Qun, Feng Shen, Lan Xin, Fairy Snow Gale, and Shang Yuetian all greeted Lin Ming. Of these people, Lin Ming had already seen all of them before.

“Little Brother Lin, I’m Li Yuxiao, the ruler of the Seven Star Divine Kingdom.” The only one Lin Ming hadn’t met before was the Seven Star Divine Kingdom’s Divine Emperor, Li Yuxiao’s tone was very pleasant and relaxed, even forgoing his title of Divine Emperor.

“So it’s the Seven Star Divine Emperor. Me and Li Yifeng can also be considered good friends.” Lin Ming smiled in return.

“Haha, no need to be humble, we’re all family here. Quick, come and sit. We’ve asked you to come this time because we want to discuss with you a plan on how to deal with Yang Yun.”

Duanmu Qun’s sound transmitting talisman had only mentioned that Yang Yun was arranging some massive transmission array network to deal with Lin Ming; it hadn’t gone into much detail.

Lin Ming had an extreme understanding into Yang Yun, giving him a great advantage. That was because he had taken a great portion of the Ancient Devil’s memories. As they said, know yourself, know your enemy, and be invincible in battle.

Before, Lin Ming only had to hear Duanmu Qun’s message to faintly guess just what Yang Yun was plotting.

“Okay.” Lin Ming nodded. He also wanted to know what Yang Yun had been up to recently to confirm his own thoughts.

“But let’s not speak about Yang Yun’s matters first. Fairy Snow Gale, Sage Shang, I’ve discovered that there’s a battle spirit mark left in your bodies. What happened?”

A battle spirit tracing mark was not some profound and mystical tracing technique. Someone with a battle spirit could easily sense it, but it was impossible to erase if one’s will was weaker.

Hearing Lin Ming’s question, Fairy Snow Gale and Shang Yuetian both bitterly sighed. Of the Divine Sea powerhouses that had entered the Temple of Marvels, the great majority of them had a battle spirit mark left within them by Yang Yun to control them. Those like Li Yuxiao had managed to luckily escape. And to them, even if Yang Yun controlled the entire world, they could still live to a comfortable old age if they were willing to discard everything they had worked for and hideaway far away in some deep sea island. Of course, this wouldn’t be a pleasant life; they would have to live forever under Yang Yun!

Fairy Snow Gale reiterated her knowledge of everything that happened. “I have no idea just what fortuitous encounter Yang Yun managed to run into, but his battle spirit has already reached silver perfection. That goes beyond our scope of understanding.”

Fairy Snow Gale sighed. In the Sky Spill Continent, a silver level battle spirit was already a legend, and silver perfection was simply unimaginable. The only reason Fairy Snow Gale was able to recognize this boundary was because she had heard about it from Old Man Good Fortune.

Fairy Snow Gale’s Honorable Master White Fengfeng had a very good friendship with Old Man Good Fortune before her passing. As this calamity befell Fairy Snow Gale, her first thought was to look for Old Man Good Fortune to help erase the battle spirit mark within her. However, even he was helpless. A perfect silver battle spirit was not something a Divine Sea powerhouse should possess.

“According to Senior Good Fortune, there is likely a powerful divine soul that resides within Yang Yun. Perhaps this divine soul might be at the boundary above the Divine Sea, Divine Transformation. It might be at the mid or late Divine Transformation realm, or even surpass that.” As Fairy Snow Gale spoke, a sense of powerlessness filled her heart. A late Divine Sea martial artist might have the capital to be the highest under the heavens, or at least be someone close to it. As for what lay beyond the Divine Sea, such a boundary hadn’t appeared in the Sky Spill Continent in the last 100,000 years. If it weren’t for Old Man Good Fortune informing her of this, she would’ve never known about Divine Transformation.

Lin Ming nodded. Old Man Good Fortune was indeed experienced and insightful. Although he didn’t have much talent for cultivation, he stayed in the Divine Realm for many years and his horizons couldn’t be compared to a martial artist from the lower realms. He had been able to gather all the various clues and hints and come to this conclusion about Yang Yun.

Lin Ming said, “Yang Yun really does have a perfect silver battle spirit, but this battle spirit originates from a devil that came from the Sea of Miracles. That devil is temporarily residing within Yang Yun. During the Temple of Marvels, this devil once tried to possess my body, and it depended on a perfect silver battle spirit back then.

Everyone was startled by Lin Ming’s words. Li Yuxiao said, boggled, “It wanted to possess your body? Then how did you?”

Li Yuxiao looked at Lin Ming with disbelief, clearly wondering just how Lin Ming managed to escape the clutches of the Ancient Devil. During the Temple of Marvels, Lin Ming’s strength was only on par with the weakest Divine Sea powerhouse.

“I had some fortunate encounters and managed to escape with luck,” Lin Ming casually said. Everyone could hear that Lin Ming didn’t want to speak further about the topic so they didn’t push him on it.

Lin Ming said, “A perfect silver battle spirit is truly formidable, but that Ancient Devil has already been sealed away in the Sea of Miracles for the last 100,000 years. His soul has weakened, and his battle spirit should no longer be as strong as a true perfect silver battle spirit. Moreover, my own battle spirit has a special quality to it, so it won’t be difficult for me to erase the tracing mark from your body.”

Lin Ming stretched out his finger and a gray energy lingered on his fingertip, slowly spinning. This was his grandmist battle spirit. Lin Ming’s battle spirit had reached the peak of silver large success, and although its rank was slightly inferior to silver perfection, it had been tempered in grandmist energy for a long period of time and it was superior in quality to the Ancient Devil’s battle spirit.

“You can erase the battle spirit mark left behind by Yang Yun?” Fairy Snow Gale and Shang Yuetian were ecstatic to hear Lin Ming say that, and some others even glanced at him incredulously. Although they knew that Lin Ming’s battle spirit was strong, they never imagined that he could possess a perfect battle spirit at the fifth stage of Life Destruction. It was something someone at the late Divine Transformation might not even have.

The battle spirit mark that Yang Yun had placed within them was like a curse that hung over their heads. They had to be constantly careful, not daring to disobey Yang Yun’s orders in the least, lest they draw his wrath.

A Divine Sea Supreme Elder could live from 4 thousand years all the way up to 10 thousand years. In this world, they stood at the highest stage of power with everything at their fingertips. They freely wandered the world, proud and arrogant. Which one of them would possibly be willing to be slaves to others and have to send every waking moment in fear and unease?

Upon hearing that Lin Ming could erase the battle spirit tracing mark in their bodies, Fairy Snow Gale and Shang Yuetian were especially excited.

Lin Ming sent out a bit of his perception to investigate the tracing mark in their bodies. Indeed, it was a perfect silver battle spirit. He hesitated for a moment, thinking, “During the Temple of Marvels, the Ancient Devil abandoned two thirds of his soul to escape from the Magic Cube, but now it looks like the Ancient Devil didn’t discard the important part of his soul; the true core of his being was kept behind. Otherwise, his battle spirit would be like that old Imp from the Blood Slaughter Steppes and it would’ve dropped a few small boundaries.”

Reaching out his hand, a gray energy sunk into Fairy Snow Gale’s body, flowing within her and wrapping around the battle spirit mark that Yang Yun left behind.

“Little Brother Lin, if you remove these two battle spirit marks then Yang Yun will immediately know,” Shang Yuetian cautioned. Although he eagerly wished to rid the shadow of this tracing mark from his body, he also didn’t want to alert the enemy.

Lin Ming said, “If he knows, he knows. I already have a general idea of what Yang Yun is doing to deal with me. He is practicing a type of devil arts, but he still hasn’t completed it. Brother Duanmu, didn’t you say that there was nearly a month before the transmission array network has to be completed?”

“Yes.” Duanmu Qun nodded. “Yang Yun gave us two months. We now have 20 days left.”

“With several hundred array formations, wanting to lay them all down without fault is nearly impossible. These array formations must be tested and the faults must be fixed. That should take several more months to complete. Yang Yun is a very intelligent man with clever methods, the type that can even obtain oil from sand. How can he possibly give me the time to cultivate? I’m guessing that he’s practicing some demonic path cultivation method and it’ll be several more months until he reaches large success. At that time, he might even break through to the middle Divine Sea in a single go. When his cultivation reaches large success and his strength rises to another level, those hundreds of array formations should finally be fixed and ready to go. He probably thinks that day will also be my last day.”

Lin Ming was able to guess Yang Yun’s plans after thinking about it. Of course, he naturally relied on the memories of the Ancient Devil to do so.

“Demonic path cultivation method?” Shang Yuetian seemed to come to a realization. “No wonder. The last time I saw Yang Yun, his aura was much deeper and the atmosphere around him had become demonic with blood energy exuding from him. It’s completely different from the elegant and untouchable atmosphere that he had in the past.”

“Oh? Then it should be the Great Blood Refining Art.” Lin Ming confirmed his own thoughts. The Ancient Devil knew a great number of cultivation methods, but the one that suited the early Divine Sea Yang Yun the most and could rapidly increase his strength was the Great Blood Refining Art. Moreover, and most importantly, after perfecting the Great Blood Refining Art, he could lock onto a person’s blood vitality and locate anyone within a million miles. This was the ideal method for Yang Yun to hunt him down.

“Great Blood Refining Art. Everything is becoming clear now. That’s why when Yang Yun killed Yang Laotian and Ouye Hua, he drew out all of their blood essence. So it was all in order to cultivate his martial arts. There’s also those seven variation bloodline Divine Sea powerhouses that’ve gone missing in the past year. They were likely killed by Yang Yun to help his cultivation.” Fairy Snow Gale was a smart woman. Just by hearing the name of the Great Blood Refining Art, she was able to deduce what sort of cultivation method it was. Within the demonic path cultivation methods, types that used blood essence to cultivate were extremely common.

“He killed Yang Laotian, Ouye Hua, and seven variation bloodline Divine Sea powerhouse?” Lin Ming was stunned for a moment. He never thought that the Nine Furnace Highest Divine Emperor and the Sublime Smelting Imperial Grand Uncle, two characters that had lorded over the Sky Spill Continent, would actually die in such a manner and be used as Yang Yun’s tonic. The twists and turns of life were truly unpredictable.

“Little Brother Lin, since you know about the Great Blood Refining Art, that makes things easier. How about you use these next few months and flee deep into the South Sea beyond the range of the transmission arrays. You can cultivate for 8-10 years and then return to kill Yang Yun.” Li Yuxiao laughed, all smiles. The unknown was scary. Now that he knew just what Yang Yun was and what he was doing, he wasn’t really afraid anymore.

“Flee?” Lin Ming faintly smiled. “Why would I run away? Yang Yun’s devil arts haven’t been completed yet, so wouldn’t this be the best time to kill him?”

Lin Ming’s voice contained a light killing intent, causing all of the people present to be startled. They speechlessly stared at him.

Chapter 935 – Command the World

…

…

…

“Kill? You want to go and kill Yang Yun now?” Li Yuxiao stammered, his eyes wide open. He never expected that Lin Ming would have this idea. If an ordinary person were to learn of Yang Yun’s plans, they would subconsciously think of escaping. Yang Yun had arranged a wide network of transmission arrays, but no matter how great it was it still wouldn’t be enough to cover the vast and endless sea. As long as Lin Ming hid deep enough in the deep sea, somewhere that was several dozen million miles beyond the nearest transmission array, Yang Yun would have to run his legs off if he wanted to find him.

Lin Ming actually didn’t think of running away. Instead, he decided to take this chance to kill Yang Yun. This was really bewildering.

“Little Brother Lin, don’t you think this might be a bit reckless?” Shibai asked, a bit unsure. He felt that Lin Ming’s idea was too crazy, but it was also consistent with Lin Ming’s usual style. He had always been like this. At just the late Revolving Core realm, Lin Ming dared to risk his life to cross into Life Destruction and challenge every Destiny Decree master of the Asura Divine Kingdom by himself. Moreover, he had obtained victory in the end. This was a valor and determination that couldn’t be possessed by the average person.

“After closing up, Yang Yun should be more powerful than Whitedemon. Even if his supernatural powers haven’t been completed, he still has the qualifications to be the highest under the heavens.” Fairy Snow Gale pressed her eyebrows together. She didn’t try to persuade Lin Ming, instead only stating this fact. She didn’t know about the battle between Lin Ming and Whitedemon, so she could only guess just how strong Lin Ming was.

However, according to the choices and actions Lin Ming took in the past, he wouldn’t make such an insane decision unless he had confidence in himself.

“Highest under the heavens? That is only the Sky Spill Continent’s highest under the heavens.”

Lin Ming’s words left everyone speechless.

“Only the Sky Spill Continent’s highest under the heavens.”

How could any of them respond to such brave words? In Fairy Snow Gale and Lu Yuxiao’s life, their ultimate goal was to reach the late Divine Sea realm, but even that seemed a nearly impossible dream. As for someone like Shang Yuetian, he only managed to break through to the Divine Sea with lucky chances. His life’s goal was to find heavenly materials that could extend his life and help him stay on the mortal coil for a few hundred more years. As for the late Divine Sea realm? Becoming the highest under the heavens? Those were simply legendary existences to him, stories that had no relation to him at all.

It could be said that to everyone here, Yang Yun was the same as those ancient inimitable kings like the Demon Emperor and the Eightfall Thunder Emperor; a nearly unreachable boundary for them. But to Lin Ming, it wasn’t all that much.

“Little Brother Lin, you…” Shibai wasn’t sure what to say for a moment. “Yang Yun has deeply hidden abilities and his talent is also high. He’s just over 40 years old but his cultivation is at the eighth stage of Life Destruction, early Divine Sea realm. If you underestimate him, then the one who eats a loss will be you.”

Lin Ming shook his head, “Patriarch Shibai, life in the universe is endless and infinite, and the road of martial arts has no end or limit. Although Yang Yun is formidable, he is still only at the eighth stage of Life Destruction, early Divine Sea realm. Within the Divine Realm, this sort of talent isn’t much at all.”

“And in terms of lucky chances, he managed to encounter the remnant soul of the late Divine Transformation Ancient Devil and obtained his guidance. Even with all the resources at his disposal, so what? Within the Divine Realm, there are geniuses that have World Kings as their masters! Moreover, their talent, their resources, everything they possess is countless times superior to Yang Yun!

“Within the three thousand boundless universes, there’s countless individuals like Yang Yun. But nearly all of them perish as they walk on their own roads of martial arts. If Yang Yun was better than average in an aspect, it would be that his plans and ambitions are high. But on the road of martial arts, one needs a great destiny, a great will, great talent, and nearly endless resources gathered today. Only then would they have a faint hope of continuing forwards. In this, Yang Yun is far from comparing to any of them.”

“If a mere Yang Yun can force me to hide deep within the South Sea for 8-10 years before returning, then I have no need to further walk down my road of martial arts. I might as well stay in the Sky Spill Continent and be happily content with being the ‘highest under the heavens’.

Lin Ming’s words left everyone, especially proud-hearted talents like Duanmu Qun, utterly silent. Lin Ming clearly intended to enter the Divine Realm and already was planning his ascension.

While those present all laid their eyes on the late Divine Sea as their goal, Lin Ming already looked above that towards the Divine Realm, seeing the geniuses there as his competition!

Such a disparity could no longer be put in words.

Fairy Snow Gale was silent for a while, and then said with a worried voice, “Lin Ming, although you taking advantage of the time when Yang Yun’s devil arts haven’t reached perfection could be considered grasping the time, but time is still inferior to terrain. Yang Yun is cultivating deep within the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s Divine Palace. The Nine Furnace Divine Palace has a great array formation protecting it; it won’t be easy for you to forcefully break in.”

Fairy Snow gale was from the White Clan, one of the subordinate family clans of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom. She had a very good understanding into the layout and defensive measures in place at the Nine Furnace Divine Palace. The deepest center of the Nine Furnace Divine Palace was the area within the entire Sky Spill Continent with the richest and purest heaven and earth origin energy. It was natural to assume that Yang Yun was cultivating there.

“What Fairy Snow Gale says is correct. But although time isn’t as important as terrain, terrain isn’t as important as the will of the people. In order to complete his supernatural powers, Yang Yun has already lost the heart of the people. Even if the Nine Furnace Divine Palace has a great array formation, it still needs people driving the activation to display its might. Since Yang Yun is in closed door seclusion, how can he possibly do so? As for others, even if they are the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s Divine Sea powerhouses, they likely won’t be going to give their lives for someone like Yang Yun who was willing to kill his own great grandfather. He’s a devil who used despicable strong-arm tactics to take control of all the Divine Sea powerhouses under the heavens.”

“With such injustice, there’s no support from him among his people. Now is the time to strike. Fairy Snow Gale, Divine Emperor Li, Sage Shang, I ask you to help gather all of the Divine Sea powerhouses that have a tracing mark planted within them to gather here. I’ll help erase all of their tracing marks at once, and afterwards we’ll go through the transmission arrays Yang Yun has set up to go straight to the Nine Furnace Divine Palace. I’ll place down an array plate, gather everyone’s attacks together, and break through that great array formation. At that time, Yang Yun and I will have our final showdown!”

Lin Ming’s words were filled with a gritty daring and also held a deep confidence and glory. This was the so-called king’s aura. If someone heard these words, it was easy for them to be infected by the stirring emotions.

Fairy Snow Gale sighed in her heart. This sort of confidence and valor was slowly accumulated over time. If Lin Ming didn’t cultivate the martial path and stayed in the mortal world, he’d still be able to become an emperor among the people.

“Okay. I’ll summon everyone.” Shang Yuetian and Li Yuxiao said in unison. In order for Yang Yun to complete his devil arts, he had offended every Divine Sea powerhouse in the world. All these wandering people only lacked a leader to rally behind. Once they found one, they could unite and launch a counterattack on Yang Yun.

Lin Ming was the best choice to be that leader.

After they had their tracing marks erased from them, they’d inevitably be grateful to Lin Ming. With dozens of Divine Sea powerhouses joining forces in a single barrage of attacks, even the Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s array formation might not be able to withstand them. Trapped there, Yang Yun would have dug his own grave.

Shang Yuetian and the others all lit up a series of sound transmitting talismans. Over half of Yang Yun’s transmission array network had been completed. With knowledge of the approximate position of the martial artists as well as these sound transmitting talismans that could travel millions of miles, it would be quick to spread the message and gather everyone here.

…..

Shua! Shua! Shua!

Array symbols were drawn and shot into the array, joining together with an array flag. An array disc spun around in the air, quickly expanding and evolving into a large array formation as it slowly fell down.

There was a man and woman here. Both of them were Divine Sea powerhouses that were arranging a long distance transmission array.

This was the task that Yang Yun had given them.

Looking at the great array formation being completed, the man let out a light breath. He sighed, sounding a bit morose as he said, “That’s the 12th transmission array finished and we still have 20 days left. It seems that finishing this task won’t be a problem. Though I have no idea whether or not there’s any problems or mistakes when these transmission arrays are created.

This transmission array task was an absolute order upon death by Yang Yun. If they couldn’t complete them in time, the consequences would be disastrous.

The woman was silent as if she didn’t hear anything that was being said.

As the man saw this, his heart ached. He gently whispered, “Yu’er, don’t worry. Perhaps things aren’t as bad as they seem. Maybe there’s some other reason those several Divine Sea powerhouses went missing.”

The man didn’t know how to comfort and assure her. The man and woman were a married couple. The woman was called Yu’er, and she had a tracing mark left in her by Yang Yun. But that didn’t matter. What was important was that she possessed a variation bloodline called the moonlight bloodline.

Before now, seven Divine Sea powerhouses that possessed a variation bloodline had gone missing. Three of them were determined dead, and the other four were likely to have perished. The one who did all this was most likely Yang Yun. How could she not feel despair about all this? She felt like nothing more than a lamb in a cage, waiting to be slaughtered.

The man spoke a few words but couldn’t continue. He was a bit stronger than Yu’er. If this were the past and her life was in danger, he definitely could have spoken some brave words that he would protect her and keep her safe no matter what. But now, facing Yang Yun, all he felt was hopeless. The disparity between them was just too great. If he said any words about protecting his wife, even he wouldn’t believe them.

As the man was thinking about what to say, a flame suddenly lit up in front of him. It was the light of a sound transmitting talisman. The message was passed to both the man and the woman.

“Li Yuxiao. What could the Seven Star Divine Emperor want from us?”

The man was startled as he heard the message. He solemnly listened on. The sound transmitting talisman was very lengthy. When Li Yuxiao’s message mentioned Yang Yun cultivating the Great Blood Refining Art and killing the seven variation bloodline Divine Sea powerhouses to help do that, the man’s entire body trembled with rage. But as for Yu’er, her face turned paler than death and her lips quivered.

Although Li Yuxiao had no evidence, neither of them doubted his words. The two of them were also able to distinguish between right and wrong, and there was also no reason for Li Yuxiao to lie to them.

In the past they had only made some faint guesses as to what happened and they still held onto some hope. But now that they knew the exact situation, this knowledge pushed them into the abyss of despair.

“Yang Yun, that damned beast!”

The man clenched his jaws, his heart overflowing with rage and animus.

It had to be known that within many demonic path cultivation methods, the slaughter path and obscenity path weren’t separated. If his wife were to be taken by Yang Yun, then who knew just what would happen to her!

He wholeheartedly cultivated martial arts his entire life, even reaching the highest level of this continent, the Divine Sea, becoming a Peerless Emperor.

But in the end, he couldn’t even protect the woman he loved.

The man clenched his fists until his nails broke his flesh, drawing blood. However, as the message continued, his hands actually gradually relaxed. His eyes flashed with anticipation, surprise, and disbelief.

“Lin Ming has returned. He wants to gather all Divine Sea powerhouses of the Sky Spill Continent to attack the Nine Furnace Divine Palace, and he can even erase the battle spirit tracing mark in us?”

As the man looked at his wife, he could also see that she was shocked by the message. But within this shock, there was also a budding glimmer of hope.

Even if they couldn’t defeat Yang Yun, just erasing the tracing mark was a lifesaving favor.

“Not even four years have passed and Lin Ming wishes to fight Yang Yun? How could he have such strength?” The man muttered. “He also says he can remove the tracing marks. Does that mean his battle spirit has reached silver perfection? Is that even possible?”

Yu’er crumpled the sound transmitting talisman flame in her hand. She bit her lips and said, “No matter what it is, I must go and take a look. Even if I have to die in battle, I won’t allow Yang Yun to treat me as a pig to be raised in a pen.”

Chapter 936 – Erase Them All

…

…

…

Within the 100,000 mile long White Cloud Mountain Range, in a deep and desolate canyon. Here over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses had gathered within three days. Except for the 20 some Divine Sea powerhouses from the Asura Divine Kingdom and their subordinate influences and also the Northwest Great Desert, nearly every Divine Sea powerhouse from the Sky Spill Continent had arrived here today.

“Seven Star Majesty, where is Sage Lin?”

“Yes, where is Sage Lin?”

Everyone began to ask Li Yuxiao. In particular, those that had tracing marks within them or those that had a variation bloodline or divine body were especially impatient.

It had to be known that most of these people had tracing marks within them and were tightly controlled by Yang Yun. If they revolted against him and won, everything would be happy and wonderful. But if they lost, it meant death.

A Divine Sea powerhouse had thousands of years of life and were also overlords of their own lands; which one of them was willing to die? If Yang Yun hadn’t forced them into a dead end, none of them would have desperately risked their lives to resist him.

If they were to place their lives on the line in a final struggle, they needed a qualified leader to command them. Otherwise, rather than walking into the jaws of death, wasn’t it better to linger on alive?

No one doubted Lin Ming’s talent. Within the last 100,000 years of the Sky Spill Continent, he stood at the pinnacle of all geniuses. But many of these people actually lacked faith in his strength. Three to four years ago Lin Ming hadn’t even been comparable to an ordinary Divine Sea powerhouse. In such a short span of time, no matter how many lucky chances Lin Ming obtained, was it actually possible for him to possess the strength to challenge Yang Yun?

As everyone anxiously waited, Lin Ming finally emerged from the White Cloud Mountain Range’s cave dwelling. His clothes were white and unblemished, his aura was restrained, and every step he took was peaceful as if he stepped on the void, carried by the wind.

“Please remain patient.” Lin Ming lifted his hand. His voice contained an invisible energy field, making all those who heard him calm down and feel relaxed.

“He’s Lin Ming. He looks a bit different from the portraits that Yang Yun has given us.”

“Indeed. Although the appearance is similar, the atmosphere and temperament around Lin Ming cannot be contained in a simple portrait. I’ve seen many mighty people in my life. Some have a tyrannical momentum, brutal and aggressive, and some have a steady aura as if they returned to their true self, indiscernible from a mortal. But the feeling I get from Lin Ming is stranger. When I look at him, I feel like I’m facing the endless starry skies. There is no order, no borders, no limit, it is impossible for me to speculate on him!”

The one who spoke was a blue-clothed old man. He had a long white beard, and he stood atop a spinning compass that floated in the sky.

This old man was named the Sage Heavenmirror. He was a martial artist that had relied on his own strength to break into the Divine Sea, and his cultivation had reached the peak of the middle Divine Sea realm. Before the appearance of Yang Yun, Old Man Good Fortune, Whitedemon, and a few others, his strength had once been ranked in the top 10 of the Sky Spill Continent. Rumors said that the compass underneath his feet could even look into the past and prophesize the future; it was extremely mysterious.

The reason that Sage Heavenmirror had such a great prestige and fame amongst the Divine Sea powerhouses of the Sky Spill Continent was because of his sight. As he first looking at Lin Ming, he felt as if he were staring at a chaotic starry sky. In truth, this was the grandmist space.

“Sage Heavenmirror, you have the best sight amongst us. What do you think Lin Ming’s chances of defeating Yang Yun are? I’m a bit dubious about this. Perhaps after another 5-6 years pass, he might have that possibility.”

Sage Heavenmirror said, “The future is comprised of infinite changes and truths; to calculate it is easier said than done. With my current cultivation, foreseeing the destiny of a mortal nation is possible, but to discern the future fate of a True Dragon, I do not possess that ability.”

Sage Heavenmirror shook his head again and again, attracting Lin Ming’s eyes.

Lin Ming thought to himself, “I never thought that this world would actually have such an exquisite divination cultivation method. This is quite amazing.”

“Sage Lin, can you unravel the tracing mark in our bodies?” A soothing and melodious woman’s voice suddenly rang out. The one who spoke was Yu’er. She had a variation bloodline and also a tracing mark on her. If Yang Yun wished to kill her, there would be nowhere for her to escape to.

“That’s right, could you lift the tracing mark from us first?” Some people echoed Yu’ers thoughts. This was the most important immediate goal for them. If they didn’t have the tracing mark within them, then even if they lost they still had a chance of escaping.

Although Lin Ming was well known for his powerful battle spirit, the people present found it hard to believe that he could reach silver perfection in just a few years. After all, Lin Ming’s cultivation was only at the fifth stage of Life Destruction.

According to the reports from Fairy Snow Gale, one needed to have stepped into the boundaries of the late Divine Transformation to acquire a perfect silver battle spirit. From the fifth stage of Life Destruction to the late Divine Transformation realm, the distance between was already beyond their imaginations.

“I can.”

Lin Ming stretched out his hand and flicked his fingers. A grey arrow of energy zipped into Yu’er’s body. This grey energy was the grandmist battle spirit. Although it was only at the silver large success level, the quality it possessed was superior to the Ancient Devil’s perfect silver battle spirit.

The battle spirit drifted within her body. It turned into a silver grey spear that aimed towards the battle spirit mark and violently stabbed at it!

Kacha!

The battle spirit mark shattered like glass as it was instantly erased!

Ho!

A grey energy flew out from Yu’er’s body. She blinked several times, a dazed look on her face.

“Was it over?”

“This…the tracing mark is gone?”

Yu’er’s husband asked, flabbergasted. He too had a battle spirit. Although it was only at the most basic bronze forming stage, he could still sense that the battle spirit mark within Yu’er’s body had disappeared!

In just several blinks of an eye, the tracing mark that Yang Yun had left within them, a dearth perk that caused them to have trouble eating and sleeping for these past few years, was actually pulled out like radish and chopped up by Lin Ming!

This was just too easy.

There were a good number of Divine Sea powerhouses that had a battle spirit. They also soon realized this. This proved that the potency of Lin Ming’s battle spirit was greater than Yang Yun’s!

“A silver grey battle spirit, how could it be silver grey?” Sage Heavenmirror couldn’t understand what was happening. He had a great deal of understandings into the ranks of battle spirits, but he had never heard of a silver grey battle spirit before.

Lin Ming naturally wouldn’t explain further. He said, “We’re going to speed this up. Yang Yun should have already discovered that his battle spirit mark has been erased. In ten breaths of time, I’ll erase everyone’s battle spirit marks, then we’ll collectively go the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom through the transmission array and annihilate Yang Yun!”

Lin Ming’s words were filled with a zealous energy and the confidence that belonged to a king.

“Ten breaths of time? How could he possibly do that in ten breaths of time?” Some people began to wonder if Lin Ming had made a slip of the tongue. But at this time, Lin Ming flicked his fingers again and dozens of silver grey battle spirit energy balls shot out, each separately piercing into the Divine Sea powerhouses like a barrage of javelins. All of the martial artists glanced at each other, stupefied. Did Lin Ming plan to erase all of their battle spirit marks together in a single go?

This was far too aggressive!

They had all thought they needed to be extremely careful in lifting the battle spirit marks, slowly wearing them down with will over an extended period of time in order to completely erase it. When Lin Ming had wiped out the battle spirit mark in Fairy Yu’er’s body in just a few blinks of the eye, that was already astounding enough to them. They never thought that the next action Lin Ming would take would be even crazier. He wanted to obliterate every battle spirit mark at the same time!

In truth, this wasn’t too strange. Lin Ming’s grandmist battle spirit was more intense than the Ancient Devil’s battle spirit. If the Ancient Devil could leave behind multiple spirit battle marks, Lin Ming could also erase multiple battle spirit marks at once!

Peng peng peng!

Nearly indiscernible sounds came from everyone’s bodies, as if a soul was breaking. In just 10 breaths of time, several dozen battle spirit marks were completely and thoroughly destroyed by Lin Ming!

This scene left everyone speechless and in shock. Maybe, just maybe in another 3-4 years, Lin Ming really had the possibility of growing to a level where he could defeat Yang Yun!

………

At this time, deep within the Nine Furnace Divine Palace, Yang Yun was completely immersed within a blood pond. His cultivation had reached a critical point.

His entire body was covered in a diagram of blood. Viscous blood was sucked into his mouth, spreading through his meridians and seeping out of his pores. A faint trace of blood line energy and essence remained within his body.

In between Yang Yun’s eyebrows, the vertical red line began to slowly split open, revealing a bright red eyeball. This eyeball was also wrapped in a layer of blood essence; it looked extremely ghostly and eerie.

Around Yang Yun, the blood dao diagram slowly contracted as if it were about to fuse into his body. As it shrank it beat like a heart in a macabre fashion.

“It’s time. Once I absorb this blood dao diagram, my Great Blood Refining will nearly be complete. All I’ll have to do next is to fully form this Blood Law Eye. In another month or two, my Great Blood Refining Art will reach large success. At that time, I can use the Blood Law Eye to absorb a trace of Lin Ming’s bloodline and then find him anywhere within a million miles. I’ll hunt him down, kill him, and wrest away his destiny. With his great secrets in my hands, I’ll step onto the peak of martial arts!”

The red line between Yang Yun’s eyebrows was the third eye of the Great Blood Refining Art – the elementary form of the Blood Law Eye. Once this eye was completely formed, it could be used to search for Lin Ming in a range of a million miles. As for obtaining the aura of Lin Ming’s bloodline, he had already obtained that when he fought with Lin Ming several years ago at the Temple of Marvels.

To use the Blood Law Eye to absorb the aura of a bloodline; he would then completely understand Lin Ming’s position. This was the absolute best method he had decided to search for Lin Ming using the Great Blood Refining Art.

“Blood dao diagram, flesh and blood astral body, combine two as one!”

Yang Yun roared and energy erupted from his body like a volcanic explosion. A rich power of blood rose up, solidifying into tentacles. Every tentacle was only as thick as a finger, but there were thousands of them altogether.

Pa pa pa pa!

These tentacles latched onto the blood dao diagram, wanting to completely drag it into Yang Yun’s body.

The tentacles contracted as they pulled against the resistance of the blood dao diagram’s natural strength. As for Yang Yun, his eyes turned blood red, and veins stuck out from his body like wriggling worms. He was using his complete strength in the process.

“Almost there! I’m almost there!”

Yang Yun grit his teeth and watched as the blood dao diagram nearly completely sank into his body. But at that moment, he felt a deep pain stab into the deepest recesses of his soul, as if he was being pierced by needles.

“Mm? What?”

As Yang Yun was distracted, the blood dao diagram broke free from a tenth of the blood tentacles and began to expand outwards again.

“Someone has erased my battle spirit mark?” Yang Yun was enraged. A battle spirit mark was connected to his main battle spirit. If it was forcefully wiped out, it’d naturally have an impact on his body. Especially as he was in the most critical moment of his cultivation, if there was any mistake during the process then it was possible he could fall into obsession. But if it were only a single battle spirit mark being erased, that was also easily withstood.

Chapter 937 – Failure at the End

…

…

…

Yang Yun took a deep breath, his eyes flashing with a thick killing intent. Because he was closed up in seclusion, he had no time to bother tracking those Divine Sea powerhouses who he had implanted with his tracing mark. He also didn’t know that they had gathered together until one of his tracing marks was erased, causing him to experience a stabbing pain in his soul.

Although these battle spirit marks had been left by the Ancient Devil, Yang Yun had swallowed the Ancient Devil and their two souls had fused together. The Ancient Devils battle spirit mark was now the same as his, and erasing this mark caused him pain.

“Every battle spirit mark I left behind is different. The battle spirit mark that was erased was from a woman called Yu’er. To think that she’d actually dare to betray me. I wonder what methods she used to erase the tracing mark. Could this be Lin Ming’s work?”

Yang Yun shook his head, “That’s unlikely. Even if Lin Ming’s will is strong, it’s impossible for him to achieve a perfect silver battle spirit in just a few years and at only the fifth stage of Life Destruction. Perhaps it might be because of some treasure that Old Man Good Fortune found from 100,000 years ago. That old geezer had far too many cards in his hands, and he’s also crafty like a fox. Once I finish my Blood Law Eye, I’ll find and eradicate him from this world; I still have a wisp of his blood vitality with me.”

Yang Yun coldly smiled. He always had contingencies in place. Once his Great Blood Refining Art was completed, he would find Old Man Good Fortune and draw out all his blood essence.

Yang Yun separated his thoughts and stretched out the tentacles to catch the blood dao diagram again. In that shock just now only 10% of the blood tentacles had fallen off; the impact wasn’t too great.

“This battle spirit mark was erased during the most critical time of my cultivation, nearly causing me to taste defeat. After I reach large success in my cultivation, Fairy Yu’er, I’ll slowly take back this debt. It also seems as if you have a variation bloodline, heh.”

Yang Yun smiled, but his smile contained a certain cruelty to it. There was no longer the handsome and elegant demeanor he possessed in the past. A part of this was because the Great Blood Refining Art had changed his temperament, but the second, more direct reason was that he had swallowed the Ancient Devil’s soul. However, he didn’t have the ability to wipe out the Ancient Devil’s spirit mark. After they fused together, this would inevitably cause his personality to be influenced by the Ancient Devil. In fact, the current Yang Yun was no longer purely Yang Yun; he was the fusion form of Yang Yun and the Ancient Devil, with Yang Yun maintaining the final command.

Such a fusion form was an extremely unstable state. Yang Yun’s only choice was to rapidly increase his boundary in a short time and thoroughly refine the Ancient Devil’s soul, restoring his pure self. Otherwise, there was a chance that he would fall into depravity and become a twisted lunatic.

Yang Yun’s hands flashed and several hundred seals flew into the sea of blood.

“Blood dao diagram, flesh and blood astral body, combine two as one!”

Energy erupted from his body once again. Crimson tentacles shot forth like arrows, latching onto the blood dao diagram and contracting once more. With great difficulty, the dao diagram nearly entered into his body, but at this time, his body suddenly shook. A great pain burst up within his spiritual sea, nearly cracking it apart! The impact on Yang Yun’s consciousness caused several thousand blood tentacles to break apart!

At this moment, several dozen battle spirit marks that Li Ming had left in the bodies of the Divine Sea powerhouses had suddenly shattered. Yang Yun’s own divine soul came under a tremendous impact.

If this was an ordinary moment, this attack wouldn’t have mattered to Yang Yun. Besides some slight pain to his spiritual sea, there wouldn’t be any direct damage. But now, this was the most critical period of his cultivation. The sudden shock to his spiritual sea had nearly caused him to fall into madness!

It had to be known that demonic cultivation methods focused on speed, a road to obtaining power no matter the cost. Compared to the slow and steady orthodox cultivation methods, the risks were over a hundred times greater!

In absorbing the flesh, blood essences, or divine souls of others, it was easy to also inhale the chaos of their consciousness, leading to all sorts of dangers.

For instance, this Great Blood Refining Art absorbed the bloodlines of others. But this made it easy for one’s own blood vitality to be mixed up in disorder. Even if one diligently practiced this cultivation method, it’d still be easy to fall into madness, much less when one received a critical disturbance.

Puff!

Yang Yun violently vomited a mouthful of blood. He lost control of the violent and frenzied blood vitality all around him and suffered a severe backlash. Blood vessels bursted apart all over his body, and even his meridians were damaged by the tyrannical energy!

This power of blood contained a very thick resentment. This was left behind by the agony and unwillingness of those that had died. Who wanted to die and have their blood essence drawn out for others to swallow up and use for cultivating their martial arts? Those that died had walked the road of martial arts their entire life, and yet this was their final fate. How could the dead possibly accept this?

If their unwillingness wasn’t reconciled with, this would transform into resentment. In particular, those Divine Sea powerhouses that had comprehended their own battle spirit; their resentment was even more powerful. Once this resentment fused into their blood vitality, it’d form an intangible will form. If one couldn’t suppress this resentment then it would come back to bite them!

Those that cultivated martial arts had to be careful of the karma they sowed and the karma they reaped, or else they’d have to bear the power of resentment.

“Damn!”

Yang Yun savagely roared, just like a wounded beast.

However, his will was still strong enough that he had attained a perfect silver battle spirit. He forcefully suppressed the endless resentment in the sea of blood. His hair was stained red, sticking to him like a sheet of crimson oil. He looked like a devil that had climbed out from the abyss of hell!

As the blood dao diagram lost the shackles of the blood tentacles, it began to violently expand. The dao diagram sank into the sea of blood, expanded to over a hundred times its size before fusing into the sea of blood and thoroughly vanished.

Yang Yun was incensed. After coming under the influence of the Ancient Devil’s personality, he was no longer the gentle and collected Yang Yun of before, the Yang Yun who was unfathomable in his thoughts. The current Yang Yun was quick to anger and easily driven to extremes.

“Just who was it, who was able to erase dozens of the tracing marks I left behind in just a few breaths of time! Could it really be Lin Ming!? Could he have had another fortuitous encounter!?”

Yang Yun became gloomy, his face darkening. He spent several months forming this blood dao diagram, and when he was just about to succeed, he failed instead!

If he had absorbed this blood dao diagram his chances of breaking into the middle Divine Sea would have been far higher. But now he would have to expend several more months of hard work.

He also needed the 1-2 months afterwards to form the Blood Law Eye. Added together, that was nearly half a year of time.

This meant that he’d have to give Lin Ming another half year to grow. Yang Yun was fearful of Lin Ming’s talent; he didn’t want to allow him that much time.

“These ants actually dare to resist me and ruin my plans! After I kill Lin Ming, I’ll execute all of them!” Yang Yun fiercely spat out. At this time, an old and discordant voice raucously laughed from the depths of his soul.

“Jejejeje, Yang Yun, you little ungrateful beast. Do you really think that you’ve swallowed me? How laughable! Even now, you’ve already been subconsciously assimilated by me. Haven’t you noticed it yet? The original you would’ve never said such words, but now you are no longer you!”

“You, you’ve already lost who you are!”

The old and discordant voice echoed in Yang Yun’s spiritual sea. Yang Yun’s eyes suddenly turned cold. “You old thing, if you think that you can break my heart of martial arts then get lost. Sooner or later I’ll completely refine you so that you can no longer affect my personality. Now, screw off!”

Yang Yun shouted out and the old voice was immediately engulfed back into nothingness. The Ancient Devil was only a shattered soul fragment now; he had no ability to resist Yang Yun.

Yang Yun suddenly rushed out from the blood pond. His entire body was soaked in blood and his hair was a chaotic mess. His three eyes flashed with a bloodthirsty crimson light. There was no longer a hint of the previous dignified aura of the Nine Furnace Crown Prince.

“Half a year, I have to let Lin Ming grow for another half year! Damn it all! If I want to kill him, I must take advantage of the time before he’s fully grown! In this half year, my chances of breaking into the middle divine Sea are high, but who knows just what sort of progress Lin Ming will make.”

Yang Yun took out several soul recovery pills and healing pills and swallowed them all. His current condition was extremely poor. Many of his meridians were damaged and his spiritual sea was in turmoil. His will had managed to suppress the chaotic resentments within him. Otherwise, if he left these hidden dangers freely roaming, they would cause him to lose his mind in the future and fall into a demented state.

Just as Yang Yun was recuperating, a flame suddenly lit up in front of him. It was a message from an Asura Divine Kingdom powerhouse. After hearing the message, Yang Yun shot up, his heart seething with rage!

“Over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses have gathered outside the Nine Furnace Divine Palace and want to break through the great array formation? And the white-clothed youth leading them is most likely Lin Ming!?”

“Lin Ming!! I want to fight him and yet he took the initiative to deliver himself to my door!”

Yang Yun’s eyes flashed. He didn’t expect that Lin Ming would actually be bold and resolute in his actions. He had gathered the Divine Sea powerhouses of the Sky Spill Continent to siege the Nine Furnace Divine Palace!

He had concocted a plan to hunt Lin Ming down throughout the entire world, but before this plan was completed, Lin Ming had come to him!

This ruthless and valiant daring caused Yang Yun to be shocked!

“He actually chose this time to come, damn it all! It looks like those dozens of Divine Sea powerhouses all have the tracking marks erased from their bodies. Is this his handiwork? Just how did he do this!?”

Yang Yun grimaced. Lin Ming had erased his tracking marks, causing him to be injured at his most critical time. He then rushed over here full of momentum to kill him. Whether this was intentional or not, for Lin Ming to reach this step was extremely terrifying!

Lin Ming’s momentum was like a beam of light while he suffered a backlash of blood vitality. There was no way he could fight Lin Ming right now. He had to spend at least a quarter hour to suppress his injuries with a secret technique.

“Activate the Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s great array! Hold them off for me!”

After Yang Yun issued the other, he completely concentrated his thoughts on restoring his wounds.

Hu –

Outside the Nine Furnace Divine Palace, a seven-colored light barrier suddenly rose up into the air, surrounding the entire palace. This was the great protective array of the Nine Furnace Divine Palace. As a colossal influence that was almost a sixth-grade sect, the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s great protective array that guarded the Nine Furnace Divine Palace was nearly impregnable. Of course, the basis of this was that there were enough powerhouses managing it.

30 miles away from the Nine Furnace Divine Palace, Lin Ming floated high up in the sky, his white clothes fluttering in the wind. Behind him were over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses. He had unknowingly become the leader of all the Divine Sea powerhouses of the Sky Spill Continent. He was now a true king!

“Attack!”

Lin Ming was expressionless and his voice was cold. He casually waved his hand and tossed out an array disc that spun around in the air!

The dirge of the Death God had finally begun.

Chapter 938 – Nine Furnace Great Array

…

…

…

This array disc spinning in the air was arranged by Li Ming. It was a simple array formation that could gather the attacks of the over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses together. Otherwise, if their attacks were scattered, it wouldn’t be able to deal the most powerful blow.

“Everyone, let’s attack together.”

“That’s right. Bring out your complete strength. If we still try to hide anything at this point, we’re really going to die.”

“Great, take out all of your trump cards. After being suppressed for such a long time we must vent our anger, but let’s break this damned turtle shell before we do that!”

Even a mortal slave had their pride, much less these arrogant Divine Sea powerhouses. After being ruled and dominated by Yang Yun’s immense pressure for such a long time, their gathered rage had already reached the limit!

At this moment, over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses suddenly attacked with everything they had!

These Divine Sea powerhouses all stood out and blossomed from the trillions of lives on the Sky Spill Continent. Moreover, they had lived for thousands of years. Throughout the years, the amount of treasures and secrets they accumulated couldn’t be underestimated. How could any of them not have a final trump card in hand?

In this matter were failure meant death and success meant life, no one was stupid enough to stay their hand. If they did, it’d be taking their own life and the lives of everyone else here as a joke!

Many of these people not only used 120% of their strength to attack, but they also took out treasures from their spatial ring that they obtained from ancient ruins, such as earth rupturing symbols, divine thunder beads, and so on. Although these treasures were weaker than Old Man Good Fortune’s heaven perishing bead, they were still treasures left behind from 100,000 years ago; their lethality far exceeded the all-out attack of a normal Divine Sea powerhouse, equal at least to someone like Yang Laotian.

With over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses attack with all their might, the skies were obscured by energy rays!

The void trembled. The energy beams passed through the array formation and converged together, turning into a heaven shattering beam of light that savagely smashed into the Nine Furnace Divine Palace!

Just before the Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s barrier was about to be washed over by a terrifying baptism of energy, 10 powerhouses suddenly flew out from the depths of the Nine Furnace Divine Palace. Of these people, seven had scales all over their bodies, long writhing snake tails, fins, and gills. They were clearly powerhouses from the deep sea races. The three others were martial artists of the Asura Divine Kingdom. Situ Bonan was amongst them.

When enemies encountered each other, there would be particular eye reddening rage. After Situ Bonan saw Lin Ming, his vision filled with a monstrous hate. “Everyone, let’s all defend the Nine Furnace Divine Palace together!”

These 10 powerhouses were all Divine Sea level powerhouses. Seven were at the early Divine Realm and three were at the middle Divine Sea realm. They completely poured their energy into the nine great furnaces that acted as the array’s heart. At this time, none of them dared to hold back; all of them used their strongest power.

Yang Yun had been injured during his cultivation and wasn’t at his peak condition. They had to delay for time otherwise they would also be the first ones to die.

With 10 great powerhouses managing it, the Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s energy barrier array rose to another level.

Bang!

A beam of multi-colored lights smashed into the Nine Furnace Great Array like a dazzling rainbow dragon. The world shook. A terrifying explosion rang out, seeming to shake the entire Sky Spill Continent. Large patches of earth ruptured. An incomparably vast shockwave swept up into the sky. A round and glorious sun seemed to appear above the Nine Furnace Divine Palace, and mountain ranges hundreds of miles away were completely obliterated by the shockwave, turning into endless amounts of stone and dirt!

The rainbow dragon howled, as if it wished to smash the entire Nine Furnace Divine Palace deep into the ground!

The great array guarding the Nine Furnace Divine Palace violently shook, but it was far from shattering. This protective array formation represented the glory and majesty of the strongest Divine Kingdom. With 10 Divine Sea powerhouses managing it, it was able to forcefully resist the combined attacks of over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses.

In Lin Ming’s opinion, in order to break through the array, they would need to at least increase the power of the attack by 30-40%. But, everyone here had already used their complete strength; how could there be room for improvement?

“Damn, with these people managing the array formation, the power has increased several times over. Wanting to break through it in a single try is too difficult.” Veins were sticking out on Li Yuxiao’s face. Even when using 120% of their strength, they still weren’t able to break through the Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s protective array, and now anxiousness began creeping in his heart.

“Fairy Snow Gale, Yang Chenglin, you were both part of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom to begin with, do you know what weakness the Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s great array has?”

Fairy Snow Gale was inevitably an outsider, even though her family clan was subordinate to the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom. However, Yang Chenglin was part of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s royal family. He knew the exact situation of the Nine Furnace Great Array. He said with a true essence sound transmission, “This great array formation is almost without flaw. The Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s great array formation is powered by nine top grade heaven-step furnaces that combine together to suppress all power. These nine furnaces have been tempered for such a long time that they have reached the peak, nearly qualifying as saint artifacts. With the nine furnaces combined, the overall power will increase dozens of times. You can only break through using external strength.”

As he spoke, he glanced at Lin Ming, wanting to see what plan Lin Ming had this time. But he saw that Lin Ming was no longer attacking, and his eyes were shut as if he were deep in thought.

This caused him to feel distressed. He knew that Lin Ming had a nearly unparalleled understanding of array formations, but at this critical point when over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses were attacking with everything they had, they could only continue this barrage for another half an incense stick of time. Could Lin Ming be planning on thoroughly understanding this great array formation during that brief period of time and breaking through it?

It had to be known that this sort of protective array formation was nearly unsolvable to begin with; it was part of the characteristics of all protective arrays formations. It was not like killing arrays, illusion arrays, caging arrays, or other such array formations that had methods in which they could be cracked apart. Moreover, the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom had existed for so many years that they had strength close to a sixth-grade sect. For all these tens of thousands of years, they managed to produce countless chosen prides of the heavens. Although they were all inferior to Lin Ming, their knowledge still accumulated over the generations. How could the Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s great array formation they laid down possibly be solved by Lin Ming in just half an incense stick of time?

He wanted to remind Lin Ming of this, but he found that Lin Ming had sealed away his divine sense and was in a completely engrossed state. He became even more jittery.

At this time, from within the divine palace, Situ Bonan madly laughed, “Haha, if you think that you can break through this Nine Furnace Great Array, then keep on dreaming! You might not know this, but Great Emperor Yang Yun is currently cultivating his supernatural powers deep within the Nine Furnace Divine Palace. After another half an hour, he’ll finish his cultivation and leave seclusion. When he comes out, he’ll slaughter you all like chickens and pigs!”

The Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s great array heart had nine furnaces to stabilize the array. On Situ Bonan’s side, there were a total of 10 people. Nine of them were managing the divine furnaces; that was enough to resist the combined attack of 50 some Divine Sea powerhouses. As for Situ Bonan himself, he poured his energy into his voice to speak to spread his nefarious messages to everyone. His words clearly reached everyone’s ears as he tried to ruin their morale.

And indeed, if Situ Bonan managed to destroy these Divine Sea powerhouses’ morales and also buy enough time for Yang Yu to recuperate his wounds and complete his supernatural powers, they would really be defeated. He wanted them all to believe from the depths of their hearts that resistance was futile!

Of the over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses, the youngest of them was several hundred years old. They had seen and experienced many great storms and tribulations in their lives, and normally they wouldn’t be fooled by Situ Bonan’s words. However, the power and influence that Yang Yun gathered these past years was far too big. It formed a shadow that covered their hearts, making them unable to resist him.

Moreover, they had no way to determine whether or not Situ Bonan’s words were true or false. Because of this, many of them faltered, their fighting spirit shaking, causing a seed of fear to appear within them.

As this seed of fear was planted, it caused their striking power and momentum to immediately weaken by 20%.

As Li Yuxiao saw this, he was overwrought with dismay. “Sage Lin!”

Lin Ming’s eyes were shut and he remained unmoved by what was happening around him. At this time, his perception was clearly concentrated on the Nine Furnace Great Array. In his mind, the great array was reduced to countless lines, like a spherical spider web. Each silk thread of this web was made of energy. That was the backbone of the energy structure, and also the most solid parts of the Nine Furnace Great Array’s protective barrier.

Even if Lin Ming was skilled in a variety of Divine Realm array formations, it was impossible to solve the Nine Furnace Great Array and break through it in such a short time. A protective array was different from killing arrays, caging arrays, or illusion arrays. Of the latter three, in order to cage someone, kill someone, or bring someone under illusion, they all required that the person step into them, thus producing the possibility that someone could break out.

But for a protective array, it was to keep all enemies outside. And all central mechanism of an array formation were located within. Wanting to break through was easier said than done.

However, although Lin Ming was unable to find a method to resolve the Nine Furnace Great Array, he could actually rely on his understanding of array formations and also the fierce barrage of over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses to find traces of a gap!

The combined attack of over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses couldn’t be underestimated. Even if it were Yang Yun, if he were struck by this attack he would turn to ash. Of course, this all depended on whether or not they could hit him and also if they could survive to do it. These Divine Sea powerhouses had a limited cultivation; it was impossible for them to collectively strike Yang Yun. But with such a powerful attacking colliding with the unmoving Nine Furnace Great Array, the energy barrier still violently shook, causing tiny, nearly imperceptible gaps to appear.

Within Lin Ming’s perception vision, he could clearly see every weak spot in the barrier where the energy lines were thin, even on the verge of collapse.

“I’ve found it! There are a total of 12 cracks!”

Lin Ming’s eyes shot open. In that moment, his eyes were like a divine thunderbolt that fell onto the Nine Furnace Great Array.

As Situ Bonan met Lin Ming’s eyes, he had an illusion that his soul was extinguished.

“This brat! Humph! Who cares how sharp your eyes are, what’s so scary about you? Although I’m far from being your match, you’re still outside the great array. What can you possibly do to me?” As Situ Bonan thought of this, he became much more energetic. “Lin Ming, Great Emperor Yang Yun will soon leave seclusion. That moment will be your death knell. I’ll suck out your divine soul and marrow to take revenge for the Asura Divine Kingdom!”

“Is that right?” Lin Ming derisively smiled. His smile seemed to contain chilling winds from the nine nether abyss, making all who looked at him feel inexplicably frightened as their heart skipped a beat.

In the next moment, an alluring red lotus slowly bloomed behind Lin Ming. The entire sky began to reflect a gorgeous red glow!

Such a phenomenon actually faintly overshadowed the radiant light caused by the combined attack of over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses!

“Heavenly Demon martial intent – grandmist space!”

Lin Ming clearly enunciated every word, his voice cold and indifferent. At this time, his voice resounded between the heavens and earth like the solemn judgment of a divine god.

Suddenly, the Prime Emperor Force Field came enveloping down. With the support of the grandmist battle spirit, it completely swallowed up the Nine Furnace Great Array!

This anomaly stunned all the martial artists present. Situ Bonan’s heart shivered, nearly feeling as if his divine soul had fallen into illusion.

“What is that red lotus?”

Situ Bonan only needed to glance at the red lotus to feel as if his soul had been sucked out of his body. As he looked at the martial artists beside him, all of them were alarmed, like they had encountered some horrifying monster.

Chapter 939 – Complete Massacre

…

…

…

“Break!” Lin Ming roared out. The grandmist space had the power to swallow all Laws. However, even then one needed the energy to support it. Lin Ming’s current boundary was insufficient so it was impossible to reach a degree where he could swallow the entire Nine Furnace Great Array. This was a ultra-protection array that even the combined attack of 50 Divine Sea powerhouses couldn’t break. It represented the pinnacle of array formation achievements in the Sky Spill Continent!

However, if it were just the 12 cracks in the Nine Furnace Great Array where the energy lines were weak and shallow, Lin Ming could actually break through them!

Si si si!

The Heavenly Demon martial intent divided into 12 streams that rushed towards the 12 cracks in the Nine Furnace Great Array. In that moment, there were no powerful energy collisions, no dazzling divine lights, and no earthshaking bangs. The 12 cracks silently disintegrated!

The Nine Furnace Great Array was an array formation that contained the five central elements, gathering all elements as one. The power was incomparable. But in the face of the grandmist space that negated all Laws, even such an array formation was suppressed.

Every tiny spot that disintegrated was formed by countless tiny energy seals and formed a complex energy backbone, similar to a spider web. And like a spider web, every space between the energy lines that disintegrated was only the size of a grain of rice. Let alone a human being, even a fly would have trouble passing through them. As long as this gap was created, no matter how small it was, an invisible and intangible force field could pass through.

Lin Ming shouted out. The Heavenly Demon Force Field divided into 12 streams and flooded into the Nine Furnace Great Array, surging towards Situ Bonan and the others.

Lin Ming didn’t have the ability to rip apart the Nine Furnace Great Array. But if he could kill the Divine Sea powerhouses inside that were managing the nine stabilizing divine furnaces, the Nine Furnace Great Array’s power would weaken by over 50%. At that time, breaking this large array wouldn’t be difficult anymore.

“What!?”

At this time, Situ Bonan could clearly feel a vast and boundless, extremely terrifying energy pour down over him. This sort of feeling was like a mortal witnessing a great volcano erupting and watching as a trillion jins of lava rained down on them!

“Damn! What power is this, he can actually break into the Nine Furnace Great Array!? Let’s defend this little beast’s attack together, then repair the Nine Furnace Great Array!” Situ Bonan hysterically shouted. The other nine Divine Sea powerhouses didn’t dare to delay. They temporarily withdrew the energy they were pouring into the divine furnaces to resist the Heavenly Demon Force Field.

However, the Heavenly Demon Force Field was a transcendent divine might level ability. It was the capital that Empyrean Primordius relied on to walk unhindered in the boundless universe. Even if Lin Ming could only display the tiniest amount of its prestige, it was still more than enough to massacre Divine Sea martial artists.

“Death!”

Lin Ming waved his hand, his voice cold to the extreme. This aura was similar to the fabled Yama of hell, a lord who was able to sentence all to life and death with but a single brushstroke!

Bang!

Grandmist space erupted within the Nine Furnace Great Array. The five deep sea powerhouses that bore the brunt of this attack trembled. The protective true essence around their bodies melted like snow under the sun, disappearing as it entered the grandmist space.

Disintegrate all rules, decompose all energy, this was the chaos grandmist!

“How is this possible!?”

The several deep sea powerhouses were bewildered, horrified. They used their ultimate trump cards to resist this energy. Even if they were weaker, they wouldn’t be shocked if their true essence exploded in a shower of sparks before it disappeared. But they never thought that it would disappear without a trace, slowly dissipating into nothingness.

This was the first time they had ever seen something like this. How could they not be panicking?

However, this horror only lasted for less than the blink of an eye. The grandmist space covered them after which the five Emperor level deep sea powerhouses felt their protective true essence shatter. Their clothes, skin, muscles, meridians, bones, everything began to crumble down before turning into dust that disappeared into the wind. This was a complete and total annihilation.

As everyone witnessed this, their eyes turned round. Let alone those with Situ Bonan, even those 50 plus Divine Sea powerhouses standing on Lin Ming’s side felt a cold chill crawl up their spines and their palms to turn slick with sweat.

It was natural for Lin Ming to defeat a Divine Sea powerhouse; even instantly killing a Divine Sea powerhouse wasn’t a surprise. But when separated by the Nine Furnace Great Array and also dozens of miles away, to easily kill five Divine Sea powerhouses and with one of them even being at the middle Divine Sea realm, this was truly terrifying.

If Lin Ming could accomplish that, that also meant that he could take any of their lives with but a thought. Even if they were separated by dozens of miles, the result would be the same. Even with a great protective array between them, none of that would matter!

This sort of supernatural power already surpassed their scope of understanding.

Moreover, these five died in the most miserable way. Their death crept up on them silently and rapidly; a cruel death wasn’t even enough to describe it. This was true annihilation. They quietly dissipated into nothingness; even their bones and energy left this world!

In that silence, to watch the ghastly scene of five Divine Sea powerhouses turn into trillions of motes of dust, that was truly a fearful matter.

And from start to finish, Lin Ming hadn’t moved at all. Besides an enchanting red lotus blossoming behind him, he hadn’t even lifted a hand.

This scene was truly hair-raising!

What sort of cultivation method did this supernatural power come from!?

“How is this possible? How…” Situ Bonan’s eyes were like full moons. He was well aware that the only reason he hadn’t died just now was because Lin Ming hadn’t aimed at him, but instead killed the five other Divine Sea powerhouses. Otherwise, he would’ve died already, his fate the same as the dead.

With just a thought he had killed them from dozens of miles away, treating the Nine Furnace Great Array like it was nothing at all. He was simply a demonic monster!

“Run!”

This was the only thought of the survivors. None of them had the courage to face the monstrous Lin Ming.

“Run away?”

Lin Ming’s lips curved up in a cruel sneer. He only killed five first because he didn’t have full assurance he could kill all 10 Divine Sea powerhouses at once. But now that he had killed off half of them, killing the other half was that much easier.

“Grandmist space, massacre!”

Energy erupted from Lin Ming’s body. The Heavenly Demon martial intent surged out like a light-speed tsunami, rapidly swallowing up the five fleeing Divine Sea martial artists!

“Ahhhh!”

Situ Bonan emitted a miserable wail. He was the weakest and also at the last years of his life. He fell and was the first to be swallowed up by the Heavenly Demon martial intent.

Peng!

With a light sound, Situ Bonan’s protective true essence directly shattered. He watched helplessly as the grandmist space disintegrated his legs, his torso, his arms, and then his neck.

Within the grandmist space, his old flesh fell off like dead and dry bark. Blood poured out, his meridians shattered, everything silently turned to dust.

Nothing was more frightening than watching his own body dissipate like dust.

“No! Noooo!”

Situ Bonan cried out with one last unwilling roar before he was completely swallowed by the grandmist space. Everyone watched as he futilely struggled before finally being decomposed into nothingness.

Just like Situ Bonan, the other four Divine Sea powerhouses weren’t able to escape either. They were sucked into the grandmist space one at a time. With despairing cries, their protective true essence shattered and their bodies crumbled apart!

From the point that Lin Ming managed to break into the Nine Furnace Great Array, he had only taken several breaths of time to kill 10 Divine Sea martial artists. He hadn’t even taken half a step, easily slaughtering them all.

To kill with just a thought, this was the majesty of a true death god, the executioner of life and death!

“Lin, Sage Lin…”

At some unknown time, the 50 some Divine Sea powerhouses seemed to unanimously agree to half their attacks. What happened just now was no different from a dream to them. Those 10 Divine Sea powerhouses were not random minions, but Supreme Elders at similar levels of power. But facing Lin Ming, none of them had the ability to resist. If they were in their place, they would’ve encountered a similar fate.

To face someone who could kill them by just lifting a finger, they certainly felt a heavy pressure.

“Sage Ling’s supernatural powers are peerless. I didn’t think that you’d be able to contend with Yang Yun, but now I see that my judgment and experiences are shallow.”

Sage Heavenmirror sighed as he watched Lin Ming, his voice full of respect and awe. He was renowned as the god of divination, but even he couldn’t imagine that Lin Ming possessed such strength.

Lin Ming shook his head, “The reason I was able to kill those 10 Divine Sea martial artists is because I used a special martial skill. Although I didn’t move, the truth is that I was attacking with my complete strength; it wasn’t as easy as you think it was. Otherwise, I would’ve killed those 10 Divine Sea masters together instead of killing five first and then the other five.”

It wasn’t easy for Lin Ming to galvanize the grandmist space; he had to display his complete strength. And if he were to drive the grandmist space to the limit, he wouldn’t have any remaining energy to use martial skills.

But although he said that, when others saw this scene, what they witnessed was that Lin Ming killed others from dozens of miles away with just a thought, not even moving to do it.

“Alright everyone! Now that the 10 Divine Sea powerhouses that were managing the Nine Furnace Great Array are dead, that is the same as a tiger losing their teeth and claws. Let’s attack together and shatter that barrier!”

Although Lin Ming’s Heavenly Demon martial intent could dissolve the Nine Furnace Great Array to a certain extent, he wasn’t able to completely destroy it. To do that he required the strength of the others.

“Okay!”

50 plus Divine Sea powerhouses attacked again with everything they had. Dozens of light beams gathered at an array disc, condensing into a rainbow dragon that howled towards the Nine Furnace Great Array.

Bang!

The great array violently trembled. Everything within a thousand miles was completely razed to the ground by the tyrannical energy. Luckily, the Nine Furnace Divine Palace symbolized the absolute majesty and glory of the Divine Kingdom and didn’t allow mortals or martial artists to live nearby. Otherwise, this battle would’ve cost countless lives.

After the Nine Furnace Great Array lost the support of 10 Divine Sea powerhouses, it wasn’t able to withstand the massive joint attack. The energy barrier trembled more and more, and then with a loud ‘ka ka ka’ sound, a great crack finally appeared!

As soon as one crack appeared, more cracks rapidly expanded outwards, spreading through the entire array. With a long explosion, the Nine Furnace Great Array completely collapsed!

This was the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s highest array formation that represented the total accumulation of tens of thousands of years. If there were enough Divine Sea powerhouses overseeing it, then even the joint attack of 100 Divine Sea powerhouses along with the highest under the heavens wouldn’t have been able to break it!

When Yang Yun was at the Temple of Marvels, he had suppressed the many Divine Sea powerhouses with lightning speed, then killed Yang Laotian and Ouye Hua afterwards. Only due to that was his plan able to progress smoothly. Otherwise, if Yang Laotian holed up in the Nine Furnace Divine Palace for dozens of years, then Yang Yun would’ve had a big headache.

Chapter 940 – Fighting Yang Yun

…

…

…

With the Nine Furnace Great Array shattered, the Nine Furnace Divine Palace was completely exposed to the barrage of over 50 Divine Sea masters.

The massive divine palace extended over several hundred miles. There were glorious jade palaces and beautiful lake pagodas, both looking like heaven on earth. But now, everything would have to bear a devastating disaster.

“Everyone, please show mercy! The Nine Furnace Divine Palace houses a great number of my Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s disciples and clansmen. They’re all innocent! Yang Yun is currently residing in the deepest minor dimension within the Nine Furnace Divine Palace; it’ll be good as long as we can break into that area.”

As Fairy Snow Gale and Yang Chenglin saw everyone’s attacks about to fall onto the Nine Furnace Divine Palace, they quickly called out to stop them. They were part of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom and certainly didn’t hope to see the innocent disciples slaughtered.

“You two are right!” Lin Ming raised his hand, calling a stop to the attacks. He swept out with his divine sense, locking onto the position of the minor dimension in the blink of an eye. There it was, a red pagoda with a blood red light that soared into the skies. Without a doubt, that was where Yang Yun was hiding. There was nowhere else he could be.

“If you don’t want to come out, then I’ll make you!”

Lin Ming waved his hand and the Great Desolate Blood Halberd jumped into his hands. On the blood halberd, thunder and fire energy twisted together, sending out a dazzling light like a birthing sun.

Penetrating Rainbow!

Lin Ming struck down with the halberd. It was like a river of stars dropping down from the nine heavens, splitting apart the sky. A titanic power of thunder and flames wove together, and within, two faint dao diagrams appeared; they were red and purple!

For a postcelestial dao diagram to appear during a martial skill attack, this was an ability that Lin Ming gained after breaking through to the fifth stage of Life Destruction and having the dao traces engraved into his Revolving Core. Only when one’s understanding of the world’s Laws reached an extremely high boundary would this sort of phenomenon occur. These dao diagrams would be naturally formed, representing the operational rules of source energy.

“Postcelestial dao diagram!” All of the Divine Sea powerhouses were individuals with great amounts of experience. They were able to understand just what the dao diagrams appearing behind Lin Ming meant at a glance.

“This is incredible. Just a casual attack already contained a dao diagram, and moreover two dao diagrams at that. This sort of boundary has already surpassed my comprehension. I’ve heard rumors that when the Eightfall Thunder Emperor used the Sword of Judgment, a purple dao diagram would form behind him. But that was only one dao diagram! Lin Ming has two dao diagrams, and they seem to represent thunder and fire!”

“At the fifth stage of Life Destruction Lin Ming has already surpassed the Eightfall Thunder Emperor!”

As the Penetrating Rainbow shot out, the world paled. This was Lin Ming’s self-created martial skill. Although its level of finesse couldn’t compare to the supernatural powers possessed by those in the Divine Realm, it was most suited for him, a martial skill tailored to his strengths.

Bang!

Thunderfire energy crashed down like an avalanche. A long piercing cry emitted from the deepest parts of the Nine Furnace Divine Palace. A giant blood diagram emerged from the ground to welcome the Penetrating Rainbow!

The thunder and fire dao diagrams fused together, crashing into the blood diagram.

The void shattered. The red pagoda deep within the Nine Furnace Divine Palace was broken in half, completely destroyed!

A demonic red-clothed man slowly departed from the ruins. This man had three eyes. The third eye between his eyebrows seemed wrapped in red crystal as if it weren’t fully formed yet.

This person was Yang Yun. He was tranquil as he looked indifferently at Lin Ming; there was neither joy nor anger on his face.

“Yang Yun…”

Beside Lin Ming, as the other dozens of Divine Sea powerhouses saw Yang Yun appear, their eyes shrank. Even if they had Lin Ming commanding them, even if they had so many of them gathered together, now that they were truly coming face to face with Yang Yun, they felt their hearts shaking. This was the result of fame and momentum that had gathered over such a long period!

This was just like a mortal facing a fierce tiger. Even if there was a warrior on their side able to compete with the tiger, they would also find it difficult to remain calm. No one could guarantee that this brave warrior would be able to block the tiger whil also keeping them safe and sound.

Among them, only Lin Ming was calm and poised as he faced Yang Yun.

“Yang Yun, it’s been nearly four years since we’ve last crossed paths. Time flies by far too quickly.”

“Nearly four years? Haha! Haven’t you been hiding from me for these last four years? I do have to admire you though. Your strength has truly risen too quickly, and your battle spirit has also nearly reached the gold level. How else would you’ve been able to erase all my tracing marks in just several breaths of time?”

Yang Yun’s eyes shined with a cold light. Just as his cultivation method was reaching completion, Lin Ming had chosen that most critical time to disturb him, causing him to fail and even causing his soul to be damaged. He nearly fell into madness, and the Ancient Devil he had swallowed couldn’t be suppressed for a brief moment, causing it to regain consciousness. Because of that, he had nearly lost his own identity and mind.

How could Yang Yun not be furious!

Lin Ming narrowed his eyes as he gazed at Yang Yun, seeming as if he could see through him. He shook his head, “I’m still very far from possessing a gold battle spirit.”

A gold battle spirit and a silver battle spirit were fundamentally different.

A silver battle spirit was sharp and able to strengthen the attack of a martial artist. But it ultimately couldn’t directly impact the combat strength of a martial artist; it was like icing on the cake.

But a gold battle spirit was different. Once one had a gold battle spirit, their will would be so powerful that they could directly project their world of will into reality, affecting the real world.

“Lin Ming, you’re marvelous. You hid from me for years and yet you managed to choose the best time to challenge me. Destiny has truly gathered in your body. It seems that for these past four years, you’ve had another series of fortuitous encounters.”

Lin Ming slowly said, “My destiny is accumulated over time. Through victories, through escaping dangers, I have inscribed my will to win and valiant spirit into my bones. I did this without wetting myself with karma and also by resolving my fatality with the world. Naturally I’d have a great destiny on my body. However, your sins are far too heavy. You imprisoned your father and even killed your own great grandfather. Everything you’ve done will inevitably become shackles of fate that lock you down. Moreover, my so-called fortuitous encounters aren’t fortuitous encounters at all. They’re placed there for all who can obtain them to obtain them. For me to do is the result of my strength!”

Lin Ming raised the Great Desolate Blood Halberd and pointed the halberd blade towards Yang Yun’s head. The Death God Force Field and Asura Force Field invisibly spread outwards. As everyone was surrounded by this killing intent that was so thick it nearly condensed into reality, they couldn’t help but retreat to a safe distance.

A battle of this level already surpassed the limits of their strength.

Beneath Yang Yun’s steps, a crimson blood diagram appeared as he extracted a blood red sword from his spatial ring. With the blood diagram beneath his feet and a sword in his right hand, he swiped his left hand against the blade, leaving a line of blood. This was the greatest and most important battle of his life. It was time for him to fight with everything he had!

“Lin Ming, you truly deserve to be called the most outstanding talent the Sky Spill Continent has seen in the last 100,000 years. But even so, you’ll still lose to me.”

Yang Yun directed his sword at the world, his words containing a noble aura that looked down at all others with contempt. He was like the king of the heavens and earth.

However, Lin Ming only laughed as he heard Yang Yun’s words.

Yang Yun’s complexion turned a tad colder. “What are you laughing at?”

“Of course I’m laughing at you. You’ve been injured and were even forced to use an arcane ability to suppress your wounds. You even had to smear your blood essence onto your blade. To use the strength of your blood essence will cost you your lifespan. You’ve actually injured yourself just to put on such an act. You appear as if you’re filled with confidence, but all you are is a bragging faker.”

Lin Ming’s voice was light as if he were casually conversing. But as his words fell upon Yang Yun’s ears, Yang Yun felt his heart shake.

This damned brat, how did he see I was injured!

Using the Great Blood Refining Art, Yang Yun had sacrificed 300 years of his life in order to suppress his injuries. This couldn’t be seen on the surface, but Lin Ming had somehow managed to see through everything. How could he not be shocked by this? It felt as if everything he did was within Lin Ming’s control. How was this possible?

“Could he have calculated the time I would be wounded after he erased my battle spirit marks? Or does he have some divination high master assisting him from behind? No, that’s impossible!”

Lin Ming’s sudden words could be called a psychological attack. Even though Yang Yun tried not to show his emotions, he was actually tricked by Lin Ming’s words, causing the unwavering belief he had in emerging victorious to slightly shake.

Just as a brief gap appeared in Yang Yun’s thoughts, Lin Ming suddenly rushed forwards. Behind him, a blood red Prime Emperor Lotus Flower bloomed. Grandmist space came shrouding down from the skies with irresistible force!

In this life or death battle, Lin Ming naturally wouldn’t care about showing a gentleman’s fairness or honesty. Killing Yang Yun was the only goal!

“Humph! So you wanted to use your words to affect my mentality and ambush me! Your plan is calculated quite well, but this only proves that you do not have full assurance to defeat me! Blood array diagram, explode!”

Yang Yun waved his hands and the blood array diagram underneath his feet shot towards Lin Ming. As it neared him, it suddenly detonated!

Lin Ming smashed the Great Desolate blood Halberd onto the array diagram, causing his offensive rush to be slowed.

After Lin Ming took the initiative, Yang Yun was only able to sacrifice his blood array diagram to delay his attack. “Lin Ming, I’ll let you experience the glorious majesty of the Great Blood Refining Art! The Great Blood Refining Art can refine all bloodlines in the world. As long as you possess a body of flesh and blood, you will be restrained by my supernatural powers!”

“Six paths of samsara, eight ranks of demigods, blood pond of hell, refine!”

Yang Yun was covered by a blood red light that soared to the heavens. His long red hair crazily flew into the air. Behind him, a blood red scroll appeared. On it were drawn images of countless lives, and every single life was in immeasurable pain. The great ten torture methods of the world were there; shearing the nose, gouging the eyes, hot pillar, fried by oil, death by dismemberment, and the others. Not only that, but there were also the 18 hells. The black rope hell, tongue slitting hell, inferno hell, iceberg hell, and so on.

Every pain imaginable was represented within the picture scroll. Seas of blood reached the skies and waves of blood tumbled about. One only needed to look at this picture scroll to feel an incomparable constraint in their hearts. If one had to completely concentrate on this picture scroll, they would even turn mad.

Even though the 50 some Divine Sea masters were dozens of miles away, they simply didn’t have the momentum to frontally face this picture scroll. Even so, they could feel the blood within their bodies heat up, boiling, as if all the blood within their body was being called away from them with an irresistible force. Their heartbeats quickened until it seemed as if it would burst out from their chests at any moment.

“What a strange supernatural power! It can summon the power of blood from within a person’s body. If someone were to be wrapped in this scroll, they would probably be reduced to a puddle of blood in no time at all!”

“The Great Blood Refining Art is truly worthy of its reputation. It can even directly refine life!”

These Divine Sea powerhouses were all experienced individuals. They only needed to look upon the aura of the picture scroll to sense how powerful it was.

However, Lin Ming stood there, his arms crossed behind his back. Placed within the Divine Realm, the Great Blood Refining Art could only be considered a decent supernatural ability; it wasn’t anything too extraordinary. Most importantly, Yang Yun hadn’t been able to cultivate it to completion yet.

Chapter 941 – Insight Into Weakness

…

…

…

“Blood refining diagram, catch him!”

Yang Yun pointed his hand at Lin Ming, and the blood refining diagram expanded, becoming like an endless world capable of containing infinite life. It exuded a terrifying swallowing force, wanting to directly devour Lin Ming.

The blood refining diagram surged and the entire world shook. A tyrannical, cruel, and painful aura scattered outwards from the blood diagram scroll, turning into thoughts. These thoughts were hidden in the blood refining diagram, turning into agonizing beliefs that gathered together as one, finally turning into a blood red flow of energy that fell down on Lin Ming.

This ability of the Great Blood Refining Art attacked both the physical body and the divine soul. For a moment, a chilling wind blew through the world; the heavens and earth were dyed a deep red from the potent blood energy!

The 50 some Divine Sea powerhouses rapidly retreated as they saw this. Lin Ming grasped the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, his eyes flashing with a sharp light. From just this move alone, he could see that Yang Yun had reached 99% completion in the Great Blood Refining Art. The blood refining diagram was formed; all he had to do was fuse it into his body.

Although this was only a single step, the difference between the two was like the clouds and mud. In the end, the Great Blood Refining Art was a Divine Realm cultivation method only useful up to the Divine Transformation realm; it was comparable to the Great Desolate Halberd Art in fierceness. After Lin Ming experienced so many top level martial arts techniques, he simply didn’t place the Great Blood Refining Art in his eyes.

“Purple Lion Thunder Source, break it for me!”

Lin Ming’s thoughts touched upon the Heretical God Sprout. The Purple Lion Thunder Source came roaring out, crazily dashing forwards!

At the same time, Lin Ming traced his spatial ring and a purple thunder spear leapt into his hands; this was a weapon that Jiang Ziji had left behind in the Extreme Violet Ring. Using this spear with thunder-attribute cultivation methods would have a far more marvelous effect than using the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. Lin Ming lifted the purple thunder spear, fusing it with the Purple Lion Thunder Source.

The power of thunder was the natural nemesis of ghosts and blood energy. Using it to resist the blood refining diagram was the most suitable action.

The Purple Lion Thunder Source and the thunder spear combined into one, immediately transforming into a 10,000 foot long thunder lion. The thunder lion emitted an earthshaking roar as it shot towards the ten mile radius blood refining diagram.

Yang Yun’s eyes flashed with a severe light. “That is the power of a Thunder Source! A mere Life Destruction martial artist like you was actually able to control a Thunder Source, the origin of thunder!”

“Your destiny is simply monstrous and overwhelming! However, did you think you can rely on just the power of this Thunder Source to resist my Great Blood Refining Art? You’re far too na?ve! My Great Blood Refining Art is a cultivation method that touches upon the Blood Source Laws! It represents the peak of the Concept of Blood! After using it, it’ll form a blood domain, creating a self-contained space where it can dominate the rules of the world. How can it possibly be broken by your Thunder Source? I’ll now swallow your Thunder Source and take it as my own, using that power of thunder to temper my blood diagram!”

Yang Yun roared, and the 10,000 feet long purple lion was completely surrounded by the blood diagram! The thunder lion roared, but the area around it still turned a ghostly red. The blood domain was the creation of a separate space. Compared to Lin Ming’s grandmist space it was like the faint glow of the stars against a bright full moon. But Yang Yun’s cultivation was still at the peak of the early Divine Sea, just a step away from entering the middle Divine Sea realm. When he displayed this blood domain, it was able to cast over the clouds and block out the sun, bringing with it an immense power!

The blood domain wanted to suck up the Purple Lion Thunder Source’s power and completely refine it. Thunder was the power of death, but also the power of life. If it were correctly applied, it could truly be used to temper the flesh and blood. If yang Yun could integrate the Purple Lion Thunder Source into his own blood refining diagram, he would be able to strengthen the power of blood and enhance the diagram’s power.

As the Purple Lion Thunder Source was covered in the blood domain, it frantically moved left and right, but it still couldn’t break free.

At this moment, Lin Ming laughed. “Peak of the Concept of Blood? When the word ‘peak’ comes from your lips, it really is cheap. This is nothing more than a second rate cultivation method, moreover you haven’t even completed it yet. Let me show you just how I’ll break it!”

Lin Ming shouted out and energy erupted from within the Heretical God Sprout. The first four of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates opened and as the Mystic Lightning Shade activated around his body, Lin Ming’s speed instantly rose the limit.

As Lin Ming stepped on Golden Roc Shattering the Void, he instantly vanished. He passed through space and appeared right in front of the blood domain. His white clothes were like snow, flapping in the strong winds. After reaching the fifth stage of Life Destruction and engraving the dao diagrams into his Revolving Core, his aura was completely different from the past. His strength had risen to a new, higher level.

“Chasing Thunder!”

Lin Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold light. His halberd thrust outwards, and a several hundred foot thick halberd light shot out, twined with endless red lightning. The halberd light followed the blood domain’s energy fluctuations to the strongest point.

Peng!

With a shattering sound, this point was directly broken by Lin Ming. However, he didn’t stop there. In just a thousandth of a second, he attacked a total of twelve times!

These twelve attacks smashed into the strongest points of the blood domain, breaking them. As they combined together, it actually created a resonating crack in the domain.

Ka ka ka ka!

With the sound of breaking glass, the blood domain, with these twelve spots as the focal points, completely shattered. A massive power of blood poured out from the crack, causing the nearby space to be riddled with holes. As for that blood refining diagram that gathered the blood of countless tortured lives, it was also torn apart. The blood refining diagram seemed to contain a life of its own. After it was torn apart, a vast amount of blood flowed out from it, like a collapsed dam!

“What!? You broke through my blood domain!?”

Yang Yun’s eyes went fully round, his expression filled with incredulity and madness.

The blood refining diagram had been torn apart by Lin Ming, and even the blood domain had disintegrated!

The blood domain was connected to Yang Yun’s own life essence. Although it could be reformed after shattering, it’d injure his fire of life, costing him at least several months of diligent training to recover. In particular, Yang Yun was now wounded and had to use an arcane technique to suppress his injuries at a cost of several hundred years of his life. He simply couldn’t afford to be injured any more.

Most importantly, Lin Ming didn’t use absolute strength to tear through the blood refining diagram. It was impossible for his strength to reach that degree. The only possibility was that Lin Ming completely understood the weaknesses of the blood domain. In that barrage of twelve attacks that had taken a thousandth of a second, he had attacked the twelve strongest points of the blood domain, crushing them to nothing. When the blood domain lost support of its energy backbone, it simply collapsed!

“How can this be? How is this possible!?”

Yang Yun refused to accept this! He absolutely refused! This supernatural power of his had been assiduously cultivated for several years. In order to accomplish this, he accepted the universal hatred of the world and slaughtered a massive amount of vicious beasts, even slaying variation bloodline powerhouses to use them as sacrifices. But even with all he had done, the result was that Lin Ming instantly saw through all weaknesses!

If the Great Blood Refining Art reached perfection, this weakness wouldn’t exist. But Yang Yun hadn’t managed to complete the Great Blood Refining Art yet. Even so, it was impossible for someone to break it apart in such a short period of time. This simply surpassed any sort of common sense!

It was like Lin Ming had personally cultivated the Great Blood Refining Art and also clearly understood all of its energy structures.

“Could it be…”

A thought suddenly cut through Yang Yun’s mind. The only possible explanation was that Lin Ming had swallowed up the other two-thirds of the Ancient Devil’s soul. Only like this would Lin Ming have been able to see the weaknesses of the Great Blood Refining Art and break through it. It was because he already knew all of it to begin with!

“The Ancient Devil tried to seize your body, but you swallowed its soul instead!?” Yang Yun’s eyes shined with pure shock. “With your mere Life Destruction cultivation, you swallowed that soul fragment without wiping out the Ancient Devil’s spirit mark? You’re a madman!”

Yang Yun had swallowed the Ancient Devil’s soul because he was forced into a dead end. The Ancient Devil was residing in his spiritual sea to make use of him. If Yang Yun hadn’t taken action, it was highly possible that the Ancient Devil would’ve swallowed him instead. He also needed the Ancient Devil’s memories. But as for Lin Ming, he had such a great destiny on his body and yet he took the near suicidal danger of swallowing the Ancient Devil’s soul fragment and losing his personality? Was he insane?

In that split-second, Yang Yun didn’t have time to further deliberate as to what happened. Lin Ming was already rushing towards him!

Lin Ming was cold and expressionless. He indifferently said, “Yang Yun, what a coincidence, I too have a domain ability. Let me show you what a true domain is, and what it means to represent the peak of Laws!”

Behind Lin Ming, an enchanting red lotus slowly bloomed. This was the Prime Emperor Lotus Flower. As the Prime Emperor Lotus Flower appeared, it seemed as if it could cover the entire sky. The entire area within a range of 10 miles was covered in an endlessly chaotic energy, isolating all Laws and all energies.

Heavenly Demon Force Field – grandmist space!

Lin Ming’s grandmist space was countless times more profound than the blood domain. Even though he was only driving it with his fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation, it was still far more terrifying than the blood domain!

“Good! Well done Lin Ming! In order to restrict me and understand my weaknesses, you ignored the danger of losing yourself to swallow the Ancient Devil’s soul. I never imagined that you would do something like that. I was wondering just how you managed to see that I was suppressing my injuries with an arcane technique and also how you managed to easily break through the Spectral Blood Skylock Array that I laid down at the Sky Fortune Kingdom. It seems that even if you don’t practice my cultivation methods or array formations, you still have a deep understanding into all of them!”

Lin Ming disdainfully said, “Yang Yun, you really think too much of yourself. I’ve never seen you as my rival, only as a grinding stone that could help me grow. There is no way that I would do something that affects my future achievements just to defeat you. Grandmist space, cover him!”

Yang Yun was covered in the grandmist space. The energy essence within his body, his flesh and blood, his soul, everything instantly came under the tremendous pressure of the grandmist space. If he didn’t revolve his bodily protective true essence to resist it, he would turn to ash in the next moment.

Yang Yun coldly sneered, “Primordius martial intent! Humph! Whitedemon was right – you’ve really managed to comprehend the Primordius martial intent. However, what a pity. The Primordius martial intent needs someone at the Empyrean level or at least at the World King level in order to display its truly terrifying power. As for you, you’re only able to display a millionth of the Primordius martial intent’s power. Do you think that the higher level a cultivation method is, the mightier it is? If you cannot display its full power then it’s useless no matter how high ranked an ability it is! My Great Blood Refining Art is different from what you know, it’s a cultivation method that completely suits my current boundary! Since you swallowed the Ancient Devil’s memories, you should also be aware that within the Great blood Refining Art, there is an all-out desperation ability. You have forced me to use it!”

The Great Blood Refining Art refined the blood essence of myriad creatures to fuse into the body. The blood refining diagram that Yang Yun used was formed from the blood essence of myriad creatures. This power came from the blood essence of myriad creatures and wasn’t the strongest ability of the Great Blood Refining Art. The strongest aspect of the Great Blood Refining Art lay in the martial artist themselves.

In other words, that was for a martial artist to combust the power of their own flesh and blood to fight.

Chapter 942 – Coiling Martial Divine Furnace

…

…

…

Yang Yun’s expression was fierce. After fusing with the Ancient Devil’s soul, he was no longer the temperate and chivalrous person he once was. He had truly become demonic.

A bass roar rang out and he stabbed his finger out. He aimed between his eyebrows and thrust downwards!

Between Yang Yun’s eyebrows was his third eye, the Blood Law Eye. But now, Yang Yun had actually crushed this eyeball apart with his finger!

Peng!

The Blood Law Eye that was wrapped in a crystalline layer suddenly burst apart. A faint trace of blood essence swelled forth, flowing dark crimson.

To pierce through one’s own eye required a ruthless resolve. Yang Yun’s face twisted as his aura suddenly soared upwards.

After the Blood Law Eye was broken, the blood essence energy that dissipated from it was completely swallowed into Yang Yun’s mouth. His body began to change, becoming larger and thicker. Dragon-like muscles wrapped around his body. From his back, red tentacles burst out, freely waving about. His skeleton and muscles were died with a bright blood red light as the red tentacles extended thousands of feet into the sky before they completely sunk into his body.

Yang Yun’s cultivation had infinitely approached the middle Divine Sea realm. It could even be said that he had managed to step into that realm for a brief period of time.

He had to destroy the Blood Law Eye and deplete the supernatural powers that he had arduously cultivated for so many years. Only then could he completely erupt with the energy of the Great Blood Refining Art, causing his Great Blood Refining Art to forcefully enter completion!

If Yang Yun had cultivated the Great Blood Refining Art to the highest level he wouldn’t have been forced to this step. But he was severely wounded and was suppressing the injuries with an arcane technique. He now also knew that Lin Ming thoroughly comprehended all of his weaknesses. Moreover, he was covered in this grandmist space. Whether it was time, terrain, or individually, Yang Yun was in the worst state possible. If he didn’t fight Lin Ming with every ounce of strength he had, he really would perish here.

“I destroyed my own Blood Law Eye, ruining three years of my hard work just so I can have the power of blood in my body reach the limit. But if I can kill you, everything I’ve done will be worth it!

To kill Lin Ming and obtain his secrets was Yang Yun’s only chance of ascending and breaking past the Divine Sea, then the Divine Transformation, and then becoming an overlord of the Divine realm. Yang Yun’s talent by itself was nothing when placed within the endless universe. There were countless people like him, more people than there were grains of sand in the desert. And yet, they all died on their road of martial arts. To them, reaching the peak of martial arts was only a dream.

Yang Yun violently bit down on his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood. This blood turned into a blood rain that sprinkled down.

The sky filled with the blood rain. Ghostly wails filled the air, as if a trillion ghosts were weeping through the heavens and earth.

“Slaughter Demon Blood Rain! That’s a vicious and cruel martial skill within the Great Blood Refining Art. To use this move, you have to burn away your own blood essence and life force, costing a hundred years of lifespan!”

Lin Ming’s mind flashed. He knew every single one of Yang Yun’s tricks from start to finish. Life was extremely precious to a martial artist; they would only use an ability that cost life at their most desperate moments. And now, Yang Yun was using such a martial skill to bet everything he had against Lin Ming.

Every drop of the blood rain contained a primordial soul; this was from the countless beings that Yang Yun had killed to practice his Great Blood Refining Art and it contained endless resentment. If this blood rain were able to invade the divine soul it would make a person go crazy, falling into insanity until they died.

The blood rain fell like a torrential storm, recklessly pouring into the grandmist space.

The grandmist space annihilated all energy and annihilated the Laws of all existences. This naturally included blood.

With a sparking sound, drops of blood were burned away as the endless resentment was destroyed, vanishing into nihility! However, the grandmist space wasn’t invincible. To keep up its annihilating strength also consumed Lin Ming’s energy.

As Yang Yun saw large traces of his blood rain being swallowed up, he didn’t feel pained at all. He bit on his tongue once more and spat out three more masses of blood. These three masses of blood were each 100 years of his life. Combined with the previous mouthful of blood, Yang Yun had instantly burned away 400 years of his life.

More and more blood rain appeared, flooding downwards, it’s momentum increasing every second. Finally, it became like a waterfall of blood pouring down from the heavens!

As the blood rain poured down on the grandmist space, the grandmist space began to contract, shrinking more and more. As for Lin Ming, he felt energy rapidly depleting from his body!

The grandmist space was powerful, but its consumption of energy was also equally terrifying. If it weren’t Lin Ming and instead a normal martial artist, let alone massacring Divine Sea powerhouses, merely attempting to activate the grandmist space would suck their body dry of energy.

As the grandmist space was suppressed, Yang Yun felt his own strength returning to him, flooding back into him like a returning tide. At this time, after displaying arcane techniques without caring about the cost, he had finally restored his combat strength to the strongest point it had been so far.

“Hahaha! This is my greatest strength! Now, I’ll show you just how strong I am! If it weren’t for your villainous plot ruining my Great Blood Refining Art from reaching completion, I would’ve fought with you in such a condition in just a few months! But now, I’ve spent a total of 1000 years of life in order to reach this state!”

A middle Divine Sea martial artist was far different from the Life Destruction martial artist; they would have 4000-7000 years of life. But when Yang Yun was young, in order to rapidly increase his strength, he had used secret demonic arcane skills under the supervision of the Ancient Devil, costing him 2000 years of his life. Now he spent another 1000 years of his life in a single go. His fires of life already begun diminishing; it was equal to him reaching middle age. If he couldn’t kill Lin Ming and find some way to restore his life force, his potential would gradually fade away and he would never be able to make another breakthrough in his cultivation.

It could be said that Yang Yun had burned away every path to retreat.

Yang Yun revolved his energy to the limits, erupting with the strength of a middle Divine Sea martial artist as he slashed out with his sword. With his eighth stage Life Destruction as a foundation in addition to all the resources of the Ancient Devils as well as the Divine Realm cultivation methods he had practiced, it was incomparable to what a martial artist from the Sky Spill Continent could accomplish. He was even slightly superior to the Eightfall Thunder Emperor from tens of thousands of years ago.

Now with an attack that contained his complete strength, the heavens and earth seemed to lose their luster. Wind and clouds vanished and endless blood ponds from an Asura hell seemed to appear in the world.

Facing this strike, Lin Ming shouted out, “Yang Yun, even if you burn away all of your life, all you have studied is a second-rate cultivation method from the Divine Realm, even if you overturned the heavens just how much strength can you display? As for me, I have two different transcendent divine mights, I cultivate dual body and essence, and I also possess a grandmist battle spirit! My background, my Concepts, my will, everything I have is far from what the likes of you can compare with. You doing everything you can to defeat me only causes my blood to boil in excitement!”

“Burn for me, blood of the Ancient Phoenix!”

A brilliant flaming red light burst out from between Lin Ming’s eyebrows, burning the heavens and earth! Behind him, the phantom of an Ancient Phoenix appeared and soared straight into the skies!

Lin Ming grasped the Great Desolate Blood Halberd and thrust out. Even the slaughter blood energy on the halberd was burnt away!

Bang!

With an earthshaking explosion, Yang Yun’s sword light was shattered by the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. But at this time, Yang Yun extracted a three-legged furnace from his spatial ring. This furnace was engraved with countless images, and among these images were an azure dragon, vermillion bird, white tiger, and black turtle. These were the four different great Saint Beasts. This ancient furnace was stained with blood as if it had passed through countless years!

As Lin Ming saw this divine furnace, he didn’t recall anything about it. But the surrounding 50 some Divine Sea powerhouses all changed complexions.

“That is the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace! The number one divine weapon of the Sky Spill Continent!”

“Yes, that is indeed the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace, the saint artifact used to stabilize the destiny of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom. It’s quality even surpasses the Great Desolate Blood Halberd and the complete Demon Emperor Armor. It was originally in Yang Laotian’s possession, but since he died, the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace naturally fell into Yang Yun’s hands.”

“I’ve heard rumors that this saint artifact weights 2.16 million jins. This is my first time seeing it. It’s more accurate to say that this divine furnace hasn’t appeared in the world for the last 5000 years. There has never been an event dire enough for the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom to bring it out.”

As the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace appeared, Yang Yun used the power of blood to wrap around the furnace and bring it smashing down at Lin Ming!

At 2.16 million jins, this furnace was nearly four times the weight of the great Desolate Blood Halberd. And because it was refined by Yang Yun, he was able to freely control it with his thoughts and without the need to expend too much energy. This attack was similar to an ancient meteor crashing into the world. If an ordinary Divine Sea master were to be struck, their physical bodies would instantly turn to ash!

Lin Ming’s pupils shrank. He completely opened the four of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. After opening the four gates, his strength was still only at 2 million jins; it was simply not enough to counter the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace.

But he still had his true essence as well as his battle spirit.

“Grandmist battle spirit, fuse!”

The silver gray spear-shaped battle spirit shot forth from his spiritual sea and combined with the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. Lin Ming roared out, lifted his hand and threw the Great Desolate Blood Halberd!

Rumble, rumble, rumble!

As the blood halberd flew, space trembled, like 10,000 thunderclaps exploding together.

On one side was the 2.16 million jin divine furnace and other the other side was the 800,000 jin Great Desolate Blood Halberd. With both weapons flying at velocities that surpassed the speed of sound, just how terrifying would the collision be?

Dang!

The blood halberd smashed into the divine furnace. The sound of deafening thunder and drums filled the air, as space collapsed several miles around.

The Coiling Martial Divine Furnace suddenly trembled as it was bounced away. But the Great Desolate Blood Halberd also ricocheted backwards. One could see that a deep dent had appeared on the surface of the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace. This had clearly been left by the Great Desolate Blood Halberd!

As for the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, it wasn’t damaged too much. This was the power of a battle spirit. With the grandmist battle spirit supporting the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, it could be called indestructible!

“The Coiling Martial Divine Furnace was damaged!?”

“To use the 800,000 jin Great Desolate Blood Halberd to resist the 2.16 million jin Coiling Martial Divine Furnace, the one that was actually damaged was the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace!?”

As everyone saw this deep dent, they felt as though they were dreaming. This was unbelievable. The number one saint artifact of the Sky Spill Continent, the founding treasure of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom, the divine treasure that stabilized the destiny of the nation, such a weapon was actually damaged? Just how terrifying had the impact been?

In that split second, no one was able to respond properly. After Yang Yun threw out the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace, he didn’t bother with it any further. He grasped his blood sword and flashed in front of Lin Ming, his sword blade snapping forth like a biting viper as it shot towards Lin Ming’s throat.

This sword pierced through the void, its speed reaching the extreme. Lin Ming coldly sneered and retreated backwards. With a flick of his right hand, a milky white thunder ball appeared above his palm.

This was the divine thunder that Lin Ming had picked up from the 100 mile Thunder Dominion.

Chapter 943 – Heaven Punishment Divine Thunder

…

…

…

Yang Yun had never been planning on using the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace to grievously wound Lin Ming. It would’ve been enough as long as he could use it to catch a glimmer of an opportunity.

Although Yang Yun originated from the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom, what he truly excelled at was the demonic cultivation methods obtained from the Ancient Devil. To Yang Yun, the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s cultivation methods were far inferior in power to those of the Ancient Devil. The demonic cultivation methods that Yang Yun studied were not too useful in maximizing the movement and strength of the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace. Instead, what he specialized in was the demon blood sword in his hand that was refined from the Divine Realm’s devil arts.

In just the blink of an eye, Yang Yun stabbed out a thousand times!

These one thousand sword strikes each seemed as if they cut through space and time. In that moment, endless waves of blood filled the sky. One thousand crimson beams of light cut through the horizon like an army of blood dragons!

The mountain range in a radius of 100 miles, as well as the array formations of the Nine Furnace Divine palace and everywhere else were completely sliced apart by the sword strikes, reduced to smithereens!

Although Fairy Snow Gale and the others had begun evacuating the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s disciples, there was still a massive number of Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s disciples that died a horrible death under the terrifying sword lights! Even some weaker Divine Sea powerhouses had their protective true essence sliced apart by the sword light, causing their blood to tumble and surge in their bodies.

As everyone saw this, they had no choice but to rapidly withdraw. Their minds filled with shock and alarm. The Nine Furnace Divine Palace’s strongest array formation was the grand protective array, but there were also numerous array formations within. And now, the majority of them were split apart by Yang Yun. Aside from some specialized protective array formations within the palace, nearly everything had been turned to fine powder.

One thousand sword strikes blocked all paths for Lin Ming to dodge. They pointed inwards and thrust towards him!

“I know that you have some strange movement technique that has Space Laws fused in, nearly allowing you to teleport and giving you unparalleled speed. But my thousand swords can cut apart the power of space. Without the power of space under your control, I want to see how you’ll step your way out of there!”

Yang Yun rabidly shouted out. Lin Ming had already thrown away the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. He didn’t choose to retrieve it, instead taking two spears from the Extreme Violet Ring, one red and one purple. The red spear was the service weapon he obtained from Timeworn Phoenix City. Although the rank wasn’t too high, it was a solid weapon. As for the purple spear, that was the weapon of the Electric Violet Kirin Clan, part of Jiang Ziji’s collection.

Lin Ming grabbed the two spears. Behind him, a red and a purple dao diagram appeared. Highly compressed thunder and fire energy violently surged out from the Heretical God Sprout!

“Penetrating Rainbow!”

Thunder and fire twisted together. All sound between the heavens and earth was swallowed up. The glory of this thunderfire welcomed the one thousand sword lights.

An intense collision occurred. Thousands of massive fissures appeared in the ground, each of them hundreds or even thousands of feet long.

After the range of the grandmist space was suppressed by the slaughter demon blood rain, the power of Yang Yun’s cultivation method was actually overshadowed by Lin Ming’s.

Nearly all of the sword lights shattered. But the remnants began to slice through Lin Ming’s curtain of thunderfire, falling down onto him.

At this moment, several gentle glowing balls of light appeared. They were white, purple, gold, and other colors; some as large as a walnut, and some as large as a fist. Underneath the camouflage of the endless curtain of thunderfire, they silently maneuvered through the sword lights and appeared in front of Yang Yun.

“Mm? What’s this?”

Yang Yun was startled. These balls of light in front of him had their energies restrained, he couldn’t feel how powerful they were. But if they were able to break through the net of his sword light and arrive in front of him, they certainly weren’t ordinary. Moreover, in Yang Yun’s eyes, Lin Ming was an extremely tricking and cunning young man. There was no way he would use any useless supernatural abilities.

Without even thinking about it, Yang Yun drew back. He didn’t want to touch these seven balls of light.

However, as Yang Yun was retreating, the seven balls of light struck together!

Even the massive explosion of light from Penetrating Rainbow striking the sword lights was swallowed up. In the surrounding space, everything turned utterly black, making it impossible to even see your own fingers. All light was completely swallowed up without anything remaining. A purple light flickered. A purple sun suddenly appeared in the world. Every single ray of divine light that this purple sun emitted were like heavenly swords that were thousands of miles long, piercing through the world!

These balls of light were the divine thunder that Lin Ming obtained from the 1000 mile Thunder Dominion in the skies above the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. The 100 mile Thunder Dominion was a true absolute life forbidden zone. Even after Lin Ming had broken into the fifth stage of Life Destruction and swallowed up the Purple Lion Thunder Source, and even with his thunder spirit body and even with the support of the Heretical God Sprout, there was just no way for him to truly enter the 100 mile Thunder Dominion. The lightning and magnetic god trees there could easily reduce him to ashes.

The entire 100 mile Thunder Dominion was a massive array formation laid down by an Empyrean level character from the Divine Realm and used to seal away an ancient existence that seemed to be a God Beast. The reason there was infinite thunder in the skies above the 8000 mile Black Swamp, and the reason the Sea of Miracles was called the Ocean of Endless Storms, was because of this massive thunder-attribute array formation!

As for these thunderballs, they were obtained from that thunder-attribute array formation. Even if the power of that entire array formation was nothing more than a drop in the ocean, it was still the power of an Empyrean level character. The might of these thunderballs was boundless.

As that purple sun erupted, the entire world shivered. It was like the planet that the Sky Spill Continent was on wasn’t able to withstand such a divine might.

“You! How’s this possible!? This. This. This is Empyrean Thunder Punishment’s heaven punishment divine thunder! How could you possibly have obtained this strength!?”

Yang Yun shouted out in panic. 100,000 years ago, in that great divine war, Empyrean Thunder Punishment had been one of the participants and also an opponent of Empyrean Primordius. The Ancient Devil had been part of the army that stood on Empyrean Thunder Punishment’s side, he was naturally clear as to what power Empyrean Thunder Punishment held.

Of course, compared to an existence on the level of Empyrean Thunder Punishment, the Ancient Devil was only a tiny ant. But he had once clearly seen the heaven punishment divine thunder that blanketed the entire world. In his life, how could he ever forget such an apocalyptic scene?

Yang Yun had swallowed the Ancient Devil’s soul so he naturally remembered what the true power of the heaven punishment divine thunder was like. Even the tiniest insignificant speck of heaven punishment divine thunder would have an incomparably terrifying explosive power. The current Yang Yun was far weaker than the Ancient Devil of the past.

Facing this terrifying thunder light, the layers upon layers of blood fog that Yang Yun used to protect himself was burned away to nothingness. He even felt as if his own fires of life were pierced by the thunder light.

Puff!

Yang Yun violently vomited a mouthful of blood, his injuries worsening. Although he managed to avoid 70% of the heaven punishment divine thunder’s strength, he was still injured by the remaining explosive shockwaves of the heaven punishment divine thunder detonating.

“You obtained heaven punishment divine thunder from the Sea of Miracles!? That’s impossible! Although there really is a massive amount of heaven punishment divine thunder in the skies above the Sea of Miracles, it’s impossible for the likes of you to control it. How could you possible control this strength!?”

Yang Yun found this impossible to accept. He had inherited the Ancient Devil’s memories, he was well aware of the situation above the skies in the Sea of Miracles.

But no matter how much heaven punishment divine thunder there was, no matter how many magnetic god trees there were, or even if there were several thousand dragon trapping cables there, it was impossible for him to ever take any of these treasures. He would be exterminated by the divine thunder.

But now, this strength was controlled by Lin Ming. And Lin Ming’s boundary was even lower than his own!

“I already said that I have more than one transcendent divine might. My second transcendent divine might can control the power of thunder and fire. You can die in peace now!”

Lin Ming’s voice directly reached Yang Yun’s ears. He didn’t fear telling Yang Yun this, because in his eyes, Yang Yun was already a dead man standing. He took advantage of the moment when Yang Yun was severely wounded to start his attack, and he even used the power of the heaven punishment divine thunder. Moreover, Lin Ming had a complete understanding into all of Yang Yun’s weaknesses.

In this situation, how could Yang Yun ever escape Lin Ming?

“Heavenly Demon martial intent, exterminate!”

Lin Ming cried out, revolving his true essence to the limit. The Prime Emperor Lotus Flower began to bloom behind him once again. The lotus petals rose like liquid flames. The grandmist space expanded out once again!

Without the suppression of the slaughter demon blood rain, Lin Ming was able to display the full strength of the grandmist space. If Yang Yun wanted to resist Lin Ming’s grandmist space again, he would have to expend several hundred more years of his life. Even if Yang Yun had a eighth stage Life Destruction Divine Sea realm cultivation, he didn’t have the capital to burn away so much of his life, otherwise he would flicker out like a lamp without oil!

Bang!

Yang Yun was enveloped in the grandmist space. His strength, his true essence, everything began to rapidly melt and diminish due to the power of chaos. With a hissing sound, 30% of Yang Yun’s protective true essence was already consumed, and his energy was quickly weakening.

“Primordius martial intent, heaven punishment divine thunder, you actually managed to obtain the strength of two Empyreans at the same time. I refuse this! I am unwilling!” Yang Yun cried out. He bit on his tongue once again, causing a rain of blood to fall down!

“Slaughter demon blood rain!”

Yang Yun’s eyes had already turned blood red! It had to be known that Yang Yun’s fires of life had already reached the point of decline. He had even been severely wounded and was only able to suppress it with an arcane technique. Even so, he had no choice but to use the slaughter demon blood rain once more. He overdrew his life, seeming as if he would die at any moment!

Ho!

Endless blood clouds formed in the skies and a rain of blood flooded the world. The slaughter demon blood rain suppressed the grandmist space once again. However, Lin Ming only coldly smiled. “Yang Yun, a middle Divine Sea powerhouse only has 4000-7000 years of life. Your cultivation had approached the middle Divine Sea realm, and your background is also extremely deep, so you should have been able to live for more than 4000 years, perhaps even 5000 years. But now you have freely wasted away your life force and weakened your fires of life, cutting off your martial arts potential. You should know that when a martial artist is young, that is when their martial arts progress is the fastest and usually when they make any progress at all. Once they reach middle age or old age, their cultivation begins to decline, not to mention making any further breakthroughs. Even if you somehow manage to escape this battle, it’s no longer possible for you to break through into the Divine Transformation. You’re destined to die within the Divine Sea realm!”

Lin Ming’s words stabbed at Yang Yun’s heart, antagonizing him. Yang Yun had great ambitions. He dreamed of cultivating to a Divine Realm World King, Empyrean, and even reach the peak of all martial arts.

However, his talent was ordinary. Although he had lucky chances, his lucky chances couldn’t compare to martial artists that had truly great lucky chances. By consuming so much of his life, it would cause his potential to come under massive influence. This was a sore spot in his heart. And Lin Ming repeatedly poked at this sore spot, causing him to turn unhinged with rage.

“Cut the shit! Why would I escape!? I’ll kill you and claw out every secret and lucky chance from your body! Even if I have consumed some of my potential, I’ll still be able to make up for it!” As Yang Yun spoke, his eyes flashed with a bloody light. He looked ferocious like a rabid beast.

As Lin Ming saw the light in Yang Yun’s eyes, a thought popped up in his mind. “I finally understand. I thought it was strange. From the very start I was able to sense the Ancient Devil’s aura from your body. But it seems as if that Ancient Devil no longer exists in your body, and you understand what happened 100,000 years ago all too well, as if you were the Ancient Devil himself. I know what happened now. You fused together with that Ancient Devil’s soul, losing yourself in the process!”

“You have lost the prudence and wisdom you once had. Today, you are destined to die!”

Chapter 944 – Yang Yun’s Death

…

…

…

Lin Ming’s sharp words stabbed Yang Yun again and again, every new word more excruciating than the last. It was pain that pierced into his marrow!

When Lin Ming said that Yang Yun had fused with the Ancient Devil’s soul and lost himself, that was the same as saying that Yang Yun had died. It was the same as saying that Yang Yun’s body was actually being occupied by someone else!

Hearing these words, how could Yang Yun not become crazy. His eyes were blood red as he roared, “Shut up! I am me! I am Yang Yun! Lin Ming, stop trying to use your words to shake my spirit! You’re wasting your time!”

“Haha, are you feeling guilty? Are you feeling afraid? If you really believe your words, then why would you feel this? No matter what I say, the real Yang Yun would’ve remained serene without any change in his composure. But as for you, you’ve already fallen into a violent rage and turned crazy. This is because you’re no longer Yang Yun!”

“In today’s battle I already discovered that your personality has completely changed. You’ve become demented, easy to anger, hysterical at all things. The Yang Yun in my mind reveals neither happiness nor anger and his mind is unfathomable, not allowing anyone to guess what’s on his mind. You’re not Yang Yun, but the result of the fusion of Yang Yun and the Ancient Devil. The real Yang Yun has already died, don’t you know that? He died the moment that he chose to fuse with the Ancient devil! As for you, who is standing in front of me, you are nothing more than a soul fused monster!”

“Shut up shut up shut up shut up! I’ll kill you!”

Yang Yun’s eyes burned with a psychotic light. He vomited another mouthful of blood essence. In the skies, blood rained down, forming an endless waterfall of blood.

A martial artist had a limited amount of blood essence. If an ordinary martial artist were to attempt what Yang Yun was doing, they would’ve already turned into a desiccated corpse. The only reason that Yang Yun hadn’t died was because of the Great Blood Refining Art.

Facing this even more terrifying slaughter demon blood rain, Lin Ming actually loudly laughed, “Yang Yun, fusing with the Ancient Devil was your life’s greatest mistake. The current you has lost all wisdom and reasoning; you’re nothing more than a mad devil now. Your ambitions were too great, and your desires were too great. You were finally controlled by those ambitions and desires and killed yourself!”

“In the future, your demonic heart will become infinite. You’ll lose your mind, lose your personality, lose yourself and become a rabid beast!”

The real Yang Yun was able to tolerate all humiliation, keeping his thoughts immeasurable deep. He had great courage, greater determination, and was an outstanding hero of his era. If there wasn’t a problem, his future achievements would’ve surpassed the Eightfall Thunder Emperor and the Sorcerer of the Southern Wilderness; he would’ve become someone equal to the Demon Emperor or even Emperor Shakya!

But what a pity. His ambitions and his desires were too great and he was devoured by them instead!

A single wrong move and the entire game ruined!

If a martial artist’s heart demon could kill them, then their desires and ambitions could also do the same!

Yang Yun roared. He was like a demon. Then, without warning, he slammed down his jaws and bit off his tongue. He slammed his chest until his ribs shattered, forcing more blood essence onto the blood sword. The blood sword in Yang Yun’s hand began to excitedly whistle, as if it were a demon that was unsealed after 100,000 years!

Yang Yun had really gone mad, without regards to the consequences; this mouthful of blood essence cost him 800-900 years of his life.

At this point, Yang Yun didn’t even have a thousand years remaining. Although his fires of life were extremely vibrant, that was traded at the price of combusting his blood essence. Once his blood essence was burnt through, he would enter into the twilight of his life, all of his potential completely consumed!

Yang Yun’s lips and teeth were stained with blood and his hair was split apart. He looked like a demon that had crawled out from the blood abyss. He miserably chuckled, his laughter like the shrill and ugly cries of a banshee.

“Lin Ming, you have the life of an Emperor, so how would you know my pain? My heart is higher than the heavens and yet my life is more worthless than a sheet of paper! I was born a bastard, my mother nothing more than a mortal. She died a tragic death in the harem and her corpse was buried under some random hill! During my childhood my life was worth less than a dog. I had no talent, no resources, and even through the harem that was filled with factional strife and deceit, I still managed to survive!”

“When I was 12 years old, I encountered the only lucky chance of my life, and that was the Ancient Devil. However, he was only using me. He trained me, built me up just so that I could be a chess piece to him. He even planted a spell within my body! If I wasn’t able to find a suitable vessel for him to possess, then my body would be seized instead! I endured the humiliation and pain, bearing it all in my heart. In order to train in the devil arts I suffered unimaginable pain. I consumed my blood essence and my life to advance. In order to cross the trial of passion I killed the woman I loved most in the world. In order to rid myself of heart demons I cut off all my emotions!”

“I’ve paid such a great price and endured so much, all in order to take back from the heavens what I have lost! I have to become the best! I must become the greatest! I must become the king of kings! Otherwise, I’m unwilling!”

“You said I made life’s greatest mistake by swallowing that Ancient Devil, but if I didn’t do that I would’ve been the one to die. I would’ve been the one to die, don’t you know that!? If I didn’t swallow the Ancient Devil, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain its memories. If I didn’t obtain its memories, then what capital would I have to ascend to the Divine Realm and become king of everything?”

“Ahhhhh! I hate everything! I hate that the heavens are unfair! I hate that destiny mocks me! Why, why? I have sacrificed so much and yet I am still inferior to you! Why!?”

“I must kill you! I must take your secrets! That is the only chance I have left, because there’s no other road left for me to go! Great Blood Refining Art – 3000 Sword Genocide!”

Yang Yun had gone crazy. In the blink of an eye he stabbed out his sword 3000 times!

Blood essence combusted. Yang Yun’s body could no longer withstand the massive amount of energy. His wounds couldn’t be suppressed anymore. It erupted, causing his meridians to break as his body began to burst open!

“My fire of life, don’t give up, bloom with your most dazzling brilliance!”

Yang Yun’s entire body was bathed in blood. He became a blood dao diagram, taking those 3000 sword lights and shooting towards Lin Ming!

Lin Ming grasped the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, burning the blood of the Ancient Phoenix to the limit, revolving the heretical God Force to the extreme, and completely unleashing the power of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates.

“In this world, fairness does not exist to begin with. In the Divine Realm there are geniuses that are birthed with countless resources surrounding them. They have divine bodies and bloodlines inherited from their parents, and they even have World King level powerhouses as their masters. They have the best cultivation methods to practice and the most outstanding proud daughters of heaven to dual cultivate with. How do you think anyone in this world can possibly compare!?”

“My lucky chance, the Divine Crystal Magic Cube, has only given me some memories and martial arts cultivation methods. Besides a single transcendent divine might, all other cultivation methods that I gained from it aren’t necessarily any worse than those that could be provided by the Ancient Devil! While I haven’t experienced the plotting and deceit of the royal family’s harem, I also experienced a heartbreaking and dismal youth.”

“Betrayal of the one I loved, indifference of my clansmen. I had no resources and had to endure internal injuries, betting everything I had on my choice. After you were born you had the support of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom. I did not. After you showed your talent, you had unlimited resources at your disposal. I had to struggle for everything I had myself. You’re a central decision maker of the Sky Spill Continent’s greatest power, but I was only able to take my first step at a mortal martial house that is subordinate to a tiny third-grade sect.”

“The road of martial arts is to defy the will of the heavens to begin with! You blame the heavens for being unfair, then you might as well blame the world for not being flat. You place all the blame on your own destiny, and all you can think of is stealing the secrets of others for yourself. Your mind is dominated by your ambitions and your greed! You didn’t hesitate to sacrifice your very identity, even resorting to any sinister and cruel method that could help you achieve your goals. Because of this, you have doomed yourself to defeat and to death!”

“Yang Yun, the true you has already died. When I kill you, what I’m killing is the monster formed from the unification of the real Yang Yun and the Ancient Devil!”

Lin Ming’s words were all sent within one tenth of an eye blink, directly transmitting into Yang Yun’s mind with a true essence sound transmission. He didn’t even conceal knowledge of the Divine Crystal Magic Cube in his body.

This was a life or death battle to begin with; there naturally wasn’t any way for his secret to be revealed.

“Blood of the Ancient Phoenix, condense!”

With a keen phoenix cry, the blood of the Ancient Phoenix combusted and formed a golden phoenix phantom that rushed out from Lin Ming’s back. The phoenix phantom soared into the air, forming a massive flaming fire dao diagram. This dao diagram was 200 feet wide and contained countless twisting fire patterns; these were actually the mystical traces from the chaos stones in Timeworn Phoenix City!

“Purple Lion Thunder source, condense!”

“Roar!”

The Purple Lion Thunder source blitzed out from the Heretical God Sprout, howling again and again. It’s voice was like an endless thunderclap that echoed between the heavens and earth. The Purple Lion Thunder Source also turned into a thunder dao diagram. This thunder dao diagram was 300 feet wide, larger than the fire dao diagram. Innumerable thunder tracings winded on the surface of the thunder dao diagram like little electric snakes. The tracings were similar to those that were on the 12 thunder dao fruits. They represented the operating rules of the Thunder Laws.

The Ancient Phoenix phantom condensed into fire!

The Purple Lion Thunder Source condensed into thunder!

This was Lin Ming’s strongest technique, an attack which magnificence and power eclipsed Penetrating Rainbow.

Thunderfire Dao Diagram!

The halberd thrust out like the harbinger of the apocalypse. The entire world was covered by the two red and purple dao diagrams. The two dao diagrams sandwiched the world like two grinding plates, seeming as if it would grind away the world!

This was a strength that approached the Source Laws of the Great Dao. It was simply not a strength that the martial artists of the Sky Spill Continent could comprehend.

3000 sword lights all pierced the Thunderfire Dao Diagram!

Peng peng peng peng peng!

A series of ringing explosions filled the air as legions of sword lights shattered. The two great dao diagrams violently trembled. Countless thunder and fire tracings were broken by the sword lights, turning into a potent and savage energy that broke into the void!

In order to display the thunder and fire dao diagrams, Lin Ming’s consumption was also monstrous!

His cultivation was only at the fifth stage of Life Destruction. Even with the Eight Inner Hidden Gates, complete spirit body, and extremely deep reserves of energy to support him, he was still close to reaching his limit!

“Die!”

Lin Ming’s waved the blood halberd. The great dao diagrams began gathering together, squeezing Yang Yun within!

Over half of Yang Yun’s sword lights had shattered. With a low howl, blood spurted out from all over his body yet again. Behind him, the blood dao diagram reappeared and began to slowly spin around. Within the blink of an eye, Yang Yun thrust out his sword another 3000 times!

3000 sword strikes followed by another 3000 sword strikes, Yang Yun’s mortal body had already begun to collapse. His blood vessels were torn apart and he vomited mouthfuls of blood!

“You stubborn fool!”

Lin Ming’s muscles bulged out and veins stuck out from all over him like blue worms. He bit down on the tip of his tongue, spitting out a layer of blood essence. The Great Desolate Blood Halberd chopped downwards. Within the air, the thunder and fire dao diagrams finally combined together and violently exploded!

In that instant, all color vanished from the world. A raging energy swallowed up this part of the sky, cutting itself off from the world. It was like the moon collapsed and stars were sinking.

This terrifying energy completely fell onto Yang Yun. The blood sword shattered. Yang Yun’s broken body was sucked into the brutal and vicious storm. His protective true essence was torn apart like paper, his meridians crushed, and his body completely burst apart.

Chapter 945 – Ashes to Ashes

…

…

…

The light vanished and silence fell over the world. Lin Ming’s face was white and a trickle of blood dripped down from the corners of his mouth. That last strike had consumed nearly all of his strength and even cost him a bit of his life essence. This life essence could be restored later but it would require a great deal of heavenly materials.

With Lin Ming’s current level of strength, simultaneously using the Purple Lion Thunder Source and the blood of the Ancient Phoenix to activate the dual thunder and fire dao diagrams, then fusing them together was simply too much strain on his body. After all, he was still only at the fifth stage of Life Destruction.

The surrounding area within a thousand miles was completely razed to the ground. Below Lin Ming’s feet, there was a massive abyss dozens of miles deep. This was carved into the ground by Lin Ming’s final strike.

The over 50 Divine Sea powerhouses had already retreated a hundred miles away. As they watched the horrifying earth rending battle between the two come to an end, they were left speechless. For the last 100,000 years, several people appeared that qualified to be the highest under the heavens. After Yang Yun cultivated the Great Blood Refining Art, his strength could be considered among those people. But even so, he was still slain by Lin Ming. What was most terrifying was that Lin Ming was only at the fifth stage of Life Destruction. Since ancient times, the highest under the heavens always had at least a middle Divine Sea cultivation. The disparity between the fifth stage of Life Destruction and the middle Divine Sea realm was far too great. If it were an ordinary fifth stage Life Destruction martial artist, they probably wouldn’t even be able to rank on the Destiny Decree. As for a middle Divine Sea master, they could exterminate a hundred regular fifth stage Life Destruction martial artists with a wave of their hand!

Lin Ming’s foundation was already unimaginable; it was impossible to imagine. If this continued then it was likely he would be able to break into the legendary ninth stage of Life Destruction. His strength would then reach heights beyond anyone’s wildest dreams!

Without a doubt, Lin Ming was destined to ascend into the Divine Realm. But the legends and stories he would leave behind on the Sky Spill Continent would have no equal, whether it was now, in the past, or in the future.

“Yang Yun’s not dead yet?”

Lin Ming fixed his eyes, peering deep into the abyss. Yang Yun was no more than several pieces of flesh and blood, but his head still remained intact. His fires of life were weakened to the point of extinguishing and his aura was thin as cobwebs.

Lin Ming moved, landing in front of Yang Yun.

“…Lin… Ming…”

Yang Yun was bleeding from everywhere. His teeth were shattered and his tongue was bitten off cleanly. He managed to use a slight bit of energy to simulate his voice, but it still came out blurry.

“The feeling of all your ambitions being smashed apart, do you find it hard to reconcile with?” Lin Ming indifferently asked. As he looked at Yang Yun, there wasn’t any emotion in his eyes. Yang Yun had used all means possible to reach his goal no matter how nefarious they were. Now that his fate ended up like this, he deserved nothing less.”

“Hehe…” Yang Yun demonically grinned, his eyes filled with loathing and venom. “You stand in front of me as a victor, but one day, others will stand in front of you the same way. You’ll share the same fate as me, hahahahaha!”

He hated Lin Ming! He hated Lin Ming to the depths of his soul!

It was said that when people died their final parting words would be peaceful. But when Yang Yun died, all he did was crazily curse.

The original Yang Yun, whether he was lying or just exceptional at hiding his true thoughts, his outwards appearance was always that of a handsome gentleman. There was no comparison to this dying rabid dog in front of him.

It could only be said that Yang Yun had become completely demented after losing himself. His original character had completely disappeared.

Lin Ming grimly sighed. This was the fate of recklessly fusing your soul with someone else. Thinking about it, he was also extremely lucky. The divine object, the Magic Cube, was able to cleanly erase a soul mark and allow him to absorb only the memories, making it so that he was never influenced by another person’s thoughts.

This Magic Cube had caused the struggle of countless great figures within the Divine Realm. Just what secrets and uses did it truly have? What was it made from and how was it created?

The Magic Cube had a mysterious origin that was impossible to guess. In fact, up until this point, Lin Ming depended on the Magic Cube too many times. He absorbed the memories of some others, but these people had all been characters on the same level of the Demon emperor. They couldn’t compare to the Holy Lords or World Kings of the Divine Realm, much less an Empyrean.

The Magic Cube certainly had other functions. It was just that his boundary was too low to understand or utilize them.

As Lin Ming was thinking about this, he suddenly felt a burning heat emanate from his chest. This feeling came from the Magic Cube!

Ever since the Magic Cube fused into Lin Ming’s body, he never found it again. It was simply as if it had vanished. He couldn’t make contact with it or activate it. Even when he crossed Life Destruction and his body burst apart into a fog of blood, he still wasn’t able to detect a single trace of the Magic Cube.

To the Magic Cube, Lin Ming was only able to passively accept its wishes. But at this time, he was able to feel the slightest bit of will from the Magic Cube. Lin Ming only felt this trace of will when he fed the Magic Cube some blood essence.

“The Magic Cube wants to swallow Yang Yun’s blood essence?” Lin Ming’s thoughts stirred. Yang Yun was only a Divine Sea powerhouse. Before this, Lin Ming already fed the Magic Cube the blood essence of a Divine Sea Supreme Elder; the blood essence of the old Imp form the Blood Slaughter Steppes. He thought that the next rank of blood essence the Magic Cube would want would be from a Divine Transformation master. He never thought that the Magic Cube would actually be interested in Yang Yun’s blood essence.

“Jejejeje, Lin Ming, I know that you want to climb onto the peak of martial arts, but there are countless martial artists just like you, which one of them doesn’t wish to reach the peak!? How many of them will finally fail before they get there!? The road of martial arts is paved with the lives of others! Sooner or later, you’ll be the same as me, the same as me!”

Yang Yun crazily shouted out, cursing with his final breath. Lin Ming glanced at him in pity. He quietly sent out a layer of energy that covered Yang Yun’s ruined body.

“You! What are you doing?” Yang Yan was shocked. He suddenly discovered a powerful attractive force acting on him. The power of his blood vitality rapidly left his body. It was gathering towards Lin Ming!

“You, you want to swallow me!?” Yang Yun’s face gruesomely distorted. He was far too familiar with this feeling. He cultivated the Great Blood Refining Art for several years and had sucked up the life of countless vicious beasts and divine body and variation bloodline Divine Sea powerhouses. How could he not know what Lin Ming was doing?

Hu!

Blood essence rapidly left Yang Yun’s body. He was so angry that his eyes popped out of his head, a monstrous, heaven-shaking hatred within them. However, as his life force left his body, his every thought and motion slowed down and down.

Masses of blood fog formed phantoms in the air. There were flood dragons, strange fishes, white tigers, massive snakes, all sorts of Saint Beasts, all of them were swallowed up by Lin Ming. More accurately, all of it was swallowed up by the Magic Cube.

A faint scarlet vortex appeared on the surface of the Magic Cube. All of these blood phantoms were minced apart by this vortex.

Finally, the scarlet phantom of a hydra was also swallowed up by the Magic Cube. At this point, all of Yang Yun’s blood essence was completely absorbed.

Yang Yun’s face was already white and filled with defeat; his last breath was near. Lin Ming couldn’t help but sigh at just how tenacious Yang Yun’s life was. Normally, if a Divine Sea powerhouse had their head chopped off they would live for less than ten breaths of time. But Yang Yun struggled around and around, still hanging onto that single breath.

This was obviously because of the Great Blood Refining art. Yang Yun had refined countless bloodlines into himself that were filled with an exuberant and stubborn vitality, including even the stalwart hydra bloodline.

“It looks like even Whitedemon was swallowed up by Yang Yun.” Lin Ming recognized the hydra phantom; he sensed the aura of Whitedemon coming from it. Within the Divine Realm, the hydra bloodline was also a considerably powerful clan with countless clansmen spread throughout.

“Lin Ming, there’ll be a day, when you…”

Yang Yun was sending out his final curse, but as he spoke, his head suddenly split apart. A crack appeared from his forehead, extending down to his lower jaw like a knife that passed through a watermelon. His head exploded.

Yang Yun’s voice was stopped short. He had thoroughly died.

However, at the moment when Yang Yun’s head split apart, a tiny wisp of remnant shot out, its soul force extremely weak. It violently thrashed and twisted about. This soul emitted the aura of the Ancient Devil.

This was a wisp of the Ancient Devil’s remnant soul that Yang Yun hadn’t fused with, instead choosing to suppress it within his spiritual sea. Now that Yang Yuns’ spiritual sea had broken apart, this tiny wisp of soul had no place left to hide.

The Magic Cube didn’t seem to have any interest in swallowing up this soul wisp, instead remaining silent. In the Temple of Marvels, the reason that the Magic Cube swallowed the Ancient Devil’s soul was because it had taken the initiative to deliver itself to the Magic Cube when it tried to seize Lin Ming’s body.

“Yang Yun has already died and you still have a wisp of soul left over? That’s really persistent of you.” Lin Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he pinched that wisp of soul in his fist.

Screech screech!

That soul wisp sent out tiny screams as it was pinched between Lin Ming’s fingers, as if it were a large rat that had been caught around the neck.

A thought entered Lin Ming’s mind. This was the voice of the Ancient Devil. “Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me! I know many secrets about the Sea of Miracles and the Eternal Demon Abyss! I also know where many powerhouses have left their treasures! You still haven’t truly entered the Sea of Miracles, I can lead you there to seek treasures!”

The Ancient Devil furiously struggled. However, Lin Ming only sneered. He twisted his fingers, and with a lighting cracking sound, the Ancient Devil was completely annihilated.

At this point, Yang Yun, Whitedemon, and the Ancient Devil were all dead!

Lin Ming took a deep breath, tracing his chest. The Magic Cube remained quiet. Although it had absorbed blood essence this time, it didn’t open the Magic Cube space.

This made Lin Ming feel a tinge of regret. It seemed that in order to open up the Magic Cube again, he would need the blood essence of a Divine Transformation realm powerhouse.

Lin Ming hypothesized that it wasn’t the Magic Cube that absorbed blood essence, but rather that powerful soul deeply sleeping within the Magic Cube. That is, the Saintess that used the Magic Cube to devour the souls of 10,000 Divine Realm Supreme Elders.

Each and every one of those Divine Realm Supreme Elders had been super powerhouses. If the Demon Emperor were ranked amongst them, he would only be extremely ordinary. But every single one of them was completely exterminated with a single move from that woman.

That woman likely needed blood essence to repair her own soul.

Before this, every time she had opened the Magic Cube after absorbing blood essence was only to inform him that she needed the blood essence of stronger powerhouses to recover.

And now, the Magic Cube sucked Yang Yun’s blood essence of its own volition. That explained a question, and that was that Yang Yun’s blood essence was finally at a high enough level for the woman to use.

This should also be because Yang Yun cultivated the Great Blood Refining Art, and the blood vitality within his body was far too exuberant and potent. A normal Divine Sea powerhouse would not have the qualifications to have their blood essence be used by that woman, because that Divine Sea boundary was far too low for her.

Chapter 946 – The Highest Under the Heavens

…

…

…

With the Magic Cube’s fluctuations, Lin Ming became aware of something. That was that the day of the Magic Cube’s awakening was approaching. If the woman’s soul within the Magic Cube could awaken, then perhaps he might be able to learn the Magic Cube’s secrets and find out just what it was.

“I have no idea whether that woman will be an enemy or friend. For someone at her level, even a wisp of her soul will have terrifying power. I have to strengthen myself as soon as possible; strength is the most fundamental truth of all.”

As Lin Ming thought this, he looked up and saw the 50 some Divine Sea powerhouses flying towards him.

There were currently around 90 Divine Sea powerhouses remaining in the entire Sky Spill Continent. These 50 some individuals accounted for the majority of them!

In peaceful times, if these 50 some individuals gathered together, that would truly be an awe inspiring scene. That was equivalent to the greatest strength of the Sky Spill Continent gathering together; just what sort of influence wouldn’t they be able to flatten and raze to the ground? If they attacked the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom, even Yang Laotian would have been frightened out of his wits, withdrawing into the Nine Furnace Divine Palace with only the great array to resist them.

But now, these 50 some people didn’t even dare to take a deep breath in front of Lin Ming. They felt an enormous pressure just being in his presence.

Lin Ming was simply far too strong. Now that he killed Yang Yun, he officially earned the title of highest under the heavens. He was someone with the status equal to the Demon Emperor of 70,000-80,000 years ago.

This was absolute domination!

Moreover, he was only at the fifth stage of Life Destruction. Breaking through another two stages of Life Destruction in 3-4 years would be as simple as eating a meal to him. He would then be able to massacre swathes of Divine Sea masters with just a thought.

Of the 90 some Divine Sea powerhouses remaining in the Sky Spill Continent, nearly half of them had relied on lucky chances to break into the Divine Sea. That was over 40 people!

Of the remaining 50, although a majority of them broke into the Divine Sea with their own strength and will, they had neither divine bodies or variation bloodlines and they weren’t even at the seventh stage of Life Destruction, but the most ordinary and common sixth stage of Life Destruction. Although they were stronger than those that relied on lucky chances to break into the Divine Sea, it would be extremely difficult for them to step foot into the middle Divine Sea realm.

Considering all factors, there were 20 people in the Sky Spill Continent that managed to break into the middle Divine Sea, and only a single person that was at the late Divine Sea realm. That was Old Man Good Fortune. All other late Divine Sea masters were slain by Yang Yun.

The Divine Sea powerhouses of the Sky Spill Continent, in terms of cultivation, strength, and foundation, could only be considered a ragtag group of martial artists in front of Lin Ming.

“Sage Lin.”

Many Divine Sea powerhouses saluted Lin Ming. As for calling him Little Brother Lin, no one dared to refer to him by that name again. This was the honor and status conferred by absolute suppression of strength. If the current Lin Ming wanted to form his own sect, he could even take his time to annex the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom and build a sixth-grade sect.

“Yang Yun, is he really dead?” Fairy Snow Gale saw Yang Yun’s corpse on the ground. His body was covered with blood and all of his blood essence was sucked out. She found this incredible. A cruel demon of his era who had managed to enslave nearly all Divine Sea powerhouses of the Sky Spill Continent for four years, the sinister and powerful Yang Yun had finally died.

It wasn’t just Fairy Snow Gale, but everyone else let out a sigh of relief. Some of them used to have a tracing mark planted within them, and those Divine Sea powerhouses with a variation bloodline felt an even greater sense of relief.

The woman called Yu’er deeply bowed to Lin Ming. “Sage Lin, killing Yang Yun is a life saving graciousness to me. I’ll carve that graciousness in my mind.”

Followed by Yu’er, a tall and robustly built middle-aged man bowed to Lin Ming. “My life and death blood brother Luo Mo died under Yang Yun’s hands. I thank Sage Lin for killing Yang Yun and completing this hatred and blood debt for me.”

With the death of Yang Yun, everyone was happy and overjoyed, finally being able to be at ease of mind.

“Sage Lin, if you have any requests for us, please speak. I shall wait until my dying breath for them!” A martial artist said.

Lin Ming calmly replied, “Yang Yun is my enemy and we were destined to have a life and death battle. Although it incidentally helped you, it isn’t a great kindness or anything like that. Whether there’s something I would like done, there is indeed something.”

“Sage Lin, please be frank. I’ll wade through water and fire to accomplish it!” The martial artists straightened themselves. So many Divine Sea powerhouses had gathered here today, and each one of them were overlords of the Sky Spill Continent that ruled over powerful influences. Just what wouldn’t they be able to do?

Lin Ming smiled. “It’s not that serious. Everyone, you’re all basically part of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom, Sublime Smelting Divine Kingdom, Seven Star Divine Kingdom, or one of their subordinate influences right?”

“Yes. There’s also some freely wandering martial artists that have no sect; around 7-8 of them are here. As for the Asura Divine Kingdom, they have a grudge with Sage Lin so they completely backed Yang Yun. We didn’t find any of them trustworthy so we didn’t contact them.” The Seven Star Divine Emperor Li Yuxiao quickly said.

“Mm.” Lin Ming nodded. “Then, I have two requests. First, I hope that in the future, there’ll only be three Divine Kingdoms around the Sea of Miracles. From this point onwards, the Asura Divine Kingdom shall no longer exist!”

Lin Ming’s request was amazing. With just several words, he directly sentenced a Divine Kingdom to obliteration. He indeed had the qualifications to say this.

Li Yuxiao sucked in a deep breath as he heard Lin Ming’s words, but he wasn’t surprised. The Asura Divine Kingdom was already as incompatible with Lin Ming as fire was to water. If Lin Ming planned to ascend into the Divine Realm in the future, he would surely leave behind his family and inheritance in the Sky Spill Continent. If there was some hostile influence greedily eyeing them, how could he possibly be at peace?

The four Divine Kingdoms had existed for over 10,000 years. Now, because of just a few words from Lin Ming, there would be one less. There would only be three great pillars remaining!

“How about it?” Lin Ming’s eyebrows shot up.

“No problem!” Not only did Li Yuxiao agree, but the other important figures from the three Divine Kingdoms also concurred. In truth, the reason the four Divine Kingdoms could co-exist with each other in a stable state for over 10,000 years was entirely because they mutually suppressed each other. The price of waging war was simply too great. As for joining forces with another Divine Kingdom to conquer another, if they could do it then others could also. The interests and subterfuge between the four Divine Kingdoms were far too complex and intricate; wanting to start a war wasn’t simple at all.

But now, because of Lin Ming, none of this was a problem!

Lin Ming said, “Exterminate the Asura Divine Kingdom. The territory, resource, and benefits will all be divided by your three Divine Kingdoms. I won’t intervene and I don’t want any of it. I only have one demand. When you do this, do not recklessly kill. Try to use peaceful means to solve conflict if possible instead. As for the inheritance and descendants of the Asura Divine Kingdom, do not slaughter them all. You may absorb them into your three Divine Kingdoms and allow them to continue to exist.”

The leaders of the three Divine Kingdoms were delighted to hear Lin Ming say this. This was equal to handing them a giant cake. With the deterrence of Lin Ming and the three Divine Kingdoms joining forces, the Asura Divine Kingdom was doomed to destruction. There likely wouldn’t be many people that would resist this. In this war, they would be able to gain the greatest harvests in exchange for the smallest losses.

As for the Asura Divine Kingdom, they had existed for over 10,000 years and the resources they accumulated were abundant beyond imagination. If the three Divine Kingdoms could equally divide in the spoils, then the many Holy Land family clans and even many fifth-grade sects would be able to take a cup of this soup.

Where could anyone find such a marvelous matter?

Lin Ming continued, “There is also another matter. The Asura Divine Kingdom has a subordinate influence called the Northwest Great Desert. There’s someone amongst them named Wang Yichan. I don’t want him to continue living on in this world.”

The reason that Lin Ming’s real identity had been exposed was because Wang Yichan had told Yang Yun. This caused the Lin Family to suffer a great catastrophe.

Lin Ming had formed a grudge with Wang Yichan during his great banquet wedding, creating a viper. After Lin Ming ascended into the Divine Realm, he didn’t want such a viper aiming at his family. If this person died, he would feel much more at ease.

“This is a minor matter. Please allow me to handle it.” Li Yuxiao volunteered. Wang Yichan was only a Life Destruction martial artist, killing him was no different from killing a chicken. As for the Northwest Great Desert, they certainly wouldn’t dare to shelter Wang Yichan. That was the same as seeking death.

From the age of 15 when Lin Ming first officially stepped onto the road of martial arts, 11 years had passed. 11 years ago, he was only an unimportant and minor character not worth remembering, but now, with just a few words, he was able to change the status quo of the Sky Spill Continent!

In the next three years the Asura Divine Kingdom would be carved up and annexed, completely vanishing from the world. As for Situ Haotian, that proud ruler of his era would be forced into a dead end and die on the road of regret. On this continent, the Asura Divine Kingdom would no longer exist and the name would fade into obscurity.

Of course, that was a story for another time.

……

Lin Ming crossed several dozen million miles to arrive at the Giant Leviathan in the South Sea.

Within a minor dimension of the Giant Leviathan, Mu Qianyu, Qin Xingxuan, Demonshine, Lin Fu, and Lin Mu were gathered together.

Even Lan Yunyue had shown up. After so many years, she finally saw Lin Fu and Lin Mu again. She was filled with guilt and embarrassment upon seeing them and deeply bowed to them.

Lin Fu and Lin Mu could’ve been said to have helped raise Lan Yunyue from childhood. As they saw her again, they were filled with emotion.

Lin Ming stood at the side, not saying anything. Mu Qianyu walked to Lin Ming’s side and asked him in a soft voice, “When do you plan on leaving?”

Lin Ming’s heart quivered. He knew this so-called ‘leaving’ was in truth ascending to the Divine Realm. When he left, it was unknown just when they would meet again. Towards Mu Qianyu, Lin Ming felt a great deal of guilt. After their great wedding, they only enjoyed a few months of tenderness and love before he had gone to the four Divine Kingdoms. During that adventure he left for several years. And now that they met each other again, he would have to ascend into the Divine realm soon.

“I haven’t really thought about it yet.” Lin Ming didn’t know what to say.

Mu Qianyu softly smiled. “You don’t have to feel guilty about anything. In truth, from the day that I gave you my heart, I knew that I might not be able to continue walking down the same path as you. I just didn’t think that day would come so soon.”

“No matter what the future brings, that is the choice I made completely of my own will and desire. You know, if you didn’t exist, I would’ve probably perished in the South Sea war. I’m also someone that walks down the road of martial arts. All of us martial cultivators take martial arts as our central focus with things like feelings and sentiment as mere distant details. When you go to the Divine Realm, do so with confidence. I’ll stay in the lower realm and handle everything here.”

Mu Qianyu whispered into Lin Ming’s ear. To a true martial artist, unless they were a martial artist that specialized in emotions, they would cultivate martial arts wholeheartedly with no time for things like feelings or sentiment. To cultivate martial arts was the struggle against the heavens. Only when a martial artist determined that there wasn’t much hope for further advancement would they settle down, taking a wife and concubines and wildly enjoying their time. Otherwise, most of them would bitterly and diligently cultivate, chasing after the Great Dao with their complete heart and will. As for feelings and sentiments, they would become somewhat indifferent to them.

Mu Qianyu was also a martial arts genius. Although she couldn’t compare to those peak Emperor level talents, she had the support of a massive amount of resources brought by Lin Ming as well a drop of the Ancient Phoenix bloodline fused into her body. It wouldn’t be too difficult for her to break into the Divine Sea in the future.

She was not the type of woman that would vacantly live her life once her man left; she also had her own road of martial arts that she desired to walk down and she was also fiercely independent. If she hadn’t met someone like Lin Ming, then not marrying for her entire life was also an acceptable matter to her.

Chapter 947 – Grandest Event Since Ancient Times

…

…

…

The next several months, Lin Ming resided in the Giant Leviathan with his family and good friends as they traveled back to the Sky Spill Continent.

During this time, Lin Ming didn’t train much. Instead, he spent his time with Mu Qianyu, Qin Xingxuan, his parents, and the others, enjoying happy days together.

After meeting each other after such a long period of separation, Lin Ming and Mu Qianyu fell into intimacy like fish into water. The two of them didn’t have much experience in this regard. As martial arts cultivators, they naturally had to suppress the passions and lusts in their hearts. But now, they were finally able to indulge to their hearts’ content.

“Lin Ming, what plans do you have with Little Sister Xingxuan? Do you plan on bringing her to the Divine Realm with you?” After a vigorous bout of lovemaking, Mu Qianyu lay down on Lin Ming’s chest. Her face was flushed red and she was lightly panting.

Lin Ming stroked his wife’s fragrant and warm breasts while thinking of the answer. Ever since the Lin Family Clan was harmed by Yang Yun, the series of events had cast a shadow on his heart. Luckily they hadn’t attached too much importance to Lan Yunyue or the consequences would have been much more serious.

If he brought Qin Xingxuan to the Divine Realm, it’d be creating a weakness for him. He had no idea what sort of powerful enemies he would make in the future. If he faced an unscrupulous enemy, they were likely to harm Qin Xingxuan.

Lin Ming’s emotions ran deep. If something really happened to Qin Xingxuan, if she was humiliated, raped, or killed, he couldn’t imagine just what he would do.

If he left Qin Xingxuan behind in the Sky Spill Continent, then even if he managed to offend some great influence in the Divine Realm, she would still be safe here because of the barrier that Empyrean Primordius had set up around the planet.

Lin Ming shook his head. “Xingxuan’s cultivation is too weak. Even with my help, it won’t be easy for her to reach the Divine Sea in the future. And passing into higher levels will be even more difficult. Besides, the channels between the Sky Spill Continent and the Divine Realm have been sealed away. If I try to bring her upwards, there might be some problems. Even now, I have no idea how to ascend. I’ll have to ask Old Man Good Fortune or the Ancient Phoenix Great Temple’s Temple Spirit for help.”

The rules of the world originally only allow a Divine Sea master to ascend to the Divine Realm. Lin Ming was currently only at the fifth stage of Life Destruction. Even if his strength already surpassed a normal late Divine Sea master, he still wasn’t able to go against this rule. If he wanted to ascend, he would likely have to pay some price; bringing someone with him would make that even harder.

Mu Qianyu said, “I want things to be simple. However, leaving Little Sister Xingxuan in the lower realms is unfair to her.”

Lin Ming felt extremely guilty as Mu Qianyu spoke. He could give Qin Xingxuan and Mu Qianyu countless lucky chances, but he eventually wouldn’t be able to walk with them.

Lin Ming took out a spatial ring. “There’s 80 million spirit essence stones here, as well as all sorts of rare and precious pills, heavenly materials, heaven-step treasures, and all sorts of other things. There’s also the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom’s national destiny stabilizing divine treasure, the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace. It can be used to stabilize the destiny of Divine Phoenix Island. With me acting as deterrence as well as the other Divine Sea powerhouses that received my help, no one should think about moving against Divine Phoenix Island for some time.”

After Lin Ming killed Yang Yun he naturally obtained all of his belongings. In addition to the Steppes Master’s treasury and the Blood Slaughter Steppes itself, Lin Ming’s wealth was incalculable.

Mu Qianyu silently received the spatial ring. This was a ridiculous amount of wealth, nearly equal to a Divine Kingdom’s national treasury. Especially the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace. That was a treasure used to stabilize the national destiny of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom; the value was unimaginable.

But Mu Qianyu wasn’t happy. She knew this was the legacy that Lin Ming was leaving her.

“Then how will you repay Little Sister Xingxuan?” Mu Qianyu asked.

“A grand marriage for the whole world to witness. We will also take this time to move Divine Phoenix Island into the central region of the Sky Spill Continent. With my power and influence, we shall stand tall there and become a Holy Land from this point on!”

……

Three months later the Giant Leviathan returned to the Sky Spill Continent. Lin Ming and everyone else passed through transmission arrays to quickly return to the central region. Before Yang Yun died, he had at least done one final good deed and that was that he had established a near perfect transmission array network. This made travelling through the Sky Spill Continent much more convenient.

Soon after, an important matter spread through the entire Sky Spill Continent. This was the news of Lin Ming’s grand marriage.

Every large sect’s Divine Sea powerhouse received invitations. The highest under the heavens, Lin Ming, was actually planning to hold a dual cultivation marriage ceremony with an unknown woman.

The three Divine Kingdoms as well as many of the Holy Lands were greatly surprised. There were even many of them that were disappointed. It had to be known that Lin Ming’s current status was that of supreme power, nearly unapproachable. Even if they knew that Lin Ming would ascend into the Divine Realm, there were still countless influences that were eagerly willing to marry their proudest daughters to him.

Even if Lin Ming ascended to the Divine Realm, he would still leave behind his fame and legacy in the Sky Spill Continent; no one would dare to move against his people, because no one could guarantee that he wouldn’t return in the future. Then again, Lin Ming’s connections were extremely deep now. Many Divine Sea powerhouses had received a lifesaving graciousness from him; they owed him a great favor.

When a martial artist reached the Divine Sea realm, it wasn’t easy for them to owe anything to anyone, because they tried to avoid involving themselves with karma. They found owing favors to others bitter to taste, and always looked for opportunities to return them. In this situation, if anyone dared to act against the family Lin Ming left behind in the Sky Spill Continent, Lin Ming wouldn’t even need to take action before that person became the target of the whole world.

Moreover, if they saved Lin Ming’s family and Lin Ming returned in the future, he would probably repay them for their kindness. It was unknown just what level of strength Lin Ming would be able to reach. Just some casual goods that he handed out might give them infinite delight.

If the great influences could choose the most exquisite and perfect woman to receive Lin Ming’s favor and have them win his heart by virtue of outstanding talent and beauty, then that was equal to climbing the great tree that was Lin Ming. They would be able to receive 10,000 years of endless good luck!

But Lin Ming was actually planning on marrying; how could all these great influences not be disappointed,

Some people were curious. They soon found out that when Lin Ming was in the South Horizon Region, he had already held a great wedding. This would be the second one. In other words, Lin Ming already had a wife.

This was good news. It was proof that Lin Ming didn’t refuse concubines. This made everything much easier to handle. It had to be known that while Lin Ming ventured in the central region for all these years, he had kept a pure heart, indifferent like ice. They feared that Lin Ming was the sort of fellow that only had martial arts in their hearts, and wholeheartedly walked down the road of martial arts with no other concerns, uninterested in the matters between men and women. If that were true, they really would have no idea where to begin.

Although individuals the great influences selected were the most glorious and proud heavenly daughters, the truth was that they didn’t care too much about being Lin Ming’s wife; even being a concubine was more than good enough.

Taking this opportunity, many great influences brought rich gifts to Lin Ming’s grand wedding as well as the most splendid heroic young elites of their sects so that they could open their eyes and expand their vision. Of course, they also brought along the most stunning and alluring young women, all of them had heaven-gifted talents.

The wedding venue was the new Vermillion Bird Palace. The Vermillion Bird Palace floated in the skies with the help of array formations. There were also several otherworldly celestial mountains floating nearby under the powered array formations. On top of these celestial mountains, there were countless multicolored rainbows that lit up the skies in dazzling glory as well as grandiose palaces dotting the landscape. There were countless rare spirit flowers and spirit trees. Countless worldly treasures bloomed under the effects of spells. These spells had the strength of a million spirit essence stones melted into them. The heaven and earth origin energy here was rich to the point that it nearly condensed into bubbles. Fragrant scents, clouds, pavilions, all sorts of beautiful sights accentuated each other. If a mortal were to take a single breath here, they would live past a hundred years in good health. This was truly an immortal fairyland within the mortal world.

In fact, most of these arrangements hadn’t been done by Lin Ming, nor did he care much about doing them. As for Divine Phoenix Island, their background was too weak and they also couldn’t arrange such sights. All of this was jointly done by the three Divine Kingdoms and the various Holy lands. They wished to make this grand wedding as glorious and resplendent as possible to please and curry favor with Lin Ming. These sects had all tried their hardest; they had really laid down a capital.

It could be said that Lin Ming’s marriage ceremony was the grandest event in the Sky Spill Continent for the last several tens of thousands of years! Perhaps only the establishing ceremony of a sixth-grade sect could reach similar heights. Otherwise, who would ever be able to move nearly 80 Divine Sea powerhouses?

Nearly all of the Divine Sea powerhouses of the Sky Spill Continent arrived; that included even the Northwest Great Desert’s Wang Yenli. As for the matter concerning his dead son, he came to this wedding with a hearty laugh, even preparing generous gifts to apologize for what his son did. He didn’t really care but about Wang Yichan’s death. He had over a thousand sons after all. He only hated that his son had possibly involved him in a calamity.

Besides the three Divine Kingdoms attending, there were also many important Holy Land figures, fifth-grade sect Sovereigns and Highest Elders, famed Elders from all around, fifth-grade family clan Patriarchs, and many others. All of them brought their own gifts.

There were also many wild and scattered martial artists that came. Although they had no sect behind them, they were still powerful characters, lords of their own lands. They had come to experience the illustriousness of the highest under the heavens. If they missed the grandest event of tens of thousands of years, they truly would feel regret.

For some time, near the new Vermillion Bird Palace and the many celestial mountains that floated in the sky, countless shining gold divine carriages appeared. There were also jade spirit boats and spirit ships, mountains, palanquins, many of them towed by auspicious Saint Beasts of all varieties. This truly seemed like a grand gathering of immortals.

Amongst all these dazzling divine carriages and spirit boats, there was an extremely simple green ox that stuck out like a sore thumb. Besides walking on a cloud, this green ox didn’t look any different from an ox that a common mortal farming family would use.

This was naturally Old Man Good Fortune’s mount.

“Hahaha, Little Friend Lin, it’s been four years since we last met, you’ve truly bloomed in magnificence. Although I already expected you to become the highest under the heavens, I didn’t think that day would come so soon! This old man didn’t receive an invitation but would you perhaps allow me to join in on the festivities?”

“Senior Good Fortune is too funny. The reason that this junior can be here today is all because I received Senior Good Fortune’s shelter and guidance. This junior wanted to request Senior Good Fortune to this wedding feast, but it’s only that Senior Good Fortune is secretive in movements, a divine dragon that doesn’t show their head, only their tail. There was no place for me to send an invitation to.”

Lin Ming pleasantly laughed. He owed Old Man Good Fortune a great deal. Even in the Temple of Marvels, Old Man Good Fortune gave Lin Ming the chance to escape. He also grievously wounded Whitedemon. If Whitedemon and Yang Yun had joined forces at that time, he would’ve never made it out alive even with the Magic Cube.

This grand event continued for nine days. But Lin Ming only appeared on the first day. He brought Qin Xingxuan around to speak to the crowd and drink with some important guests. Then they flew away together.

Many sects had brought proud, beautiful daughters of the heavens to this wedding banquet to obtain Lin Ming’s favor. All of them were left disappointed.

Chapter 948 – Incarnation of the Jade Slip

…

…

…

Atop the peak of a floating mountain, underneath the glow of multicolored lights, Lin Ming and Qin Xingxuan lay spread out on the grass, watching as the white clouds rolled past them. All the wonders around them left one intoxicated like a dream.

With the world as a bed, flowers as a blanket, a beautiful woman hugged close to his chest, Lin Ming watched the scenery around him. He stood at the very pinnacle of the Sky Spill Continent; his life could’ve been said to have reached the limit of happiness.

In these past years, if Lin Ming hadn’t been bitterly cultivating, then he was slaughtering or fleeing. He had rushed headlong into all sorts of dangerous situations with only slim hopes for survival; he never had a chance to calm his heart and enjoy his life.

If one didn’t experience such a free and glorious fairy-like life at least once, then their life would be lacking. While the road of martial arts was filled with long periods of cultivation, they also needed to become aware of themselves and their feelings. They needed to taste the hundreds of emotions in life; this was also part of cultivation.

Lin Ming gently skimmed his fingers over Qin Xingxuan’s body. She snuggled up to his chest like a cat. Both of their hearts were filled with an unprecedented peace.

After a long time passed, Qin Xingxuan seemed to suddenly remember something. She said, “Husband, before Old Man Good Fortune left, he left you a letter. You might want to take a look at it.”

Lin Ming faintly smiled. “I already know what Senior Good Fortune wants to say; it’s about the matter of ascending. Unfortunately, I cannot go along with Senior Good Fortune’s wishes. Senior Good Fortune already has a sect that he has devoted his life too and that sect is less suitable for me than the Ancient Phoenix Clan. I’m also only at the fifth-stage of Life Destruction; it’ll be difficult for him to open a space gate for me. I can only decline Senior Good Fortune’s kind intentions.”

Lin Ming planned to ascend as soon as possible; he certainly wouldn’t wait until he reached the Divine Sea. “Xingxuan, If there’s no accident, I’ll stay in the lower realms for another year or two. Before I go, I’ll help raise your cultivation to the Revolving Core and Yu’er’s cultivation to Life Destruction. Tomorrow we’ll go on a little adventure; I’ll bring you somewhere fun.”

“Mm? Where?”

“You’ll know once we get there.”

The place Lin Ming brought Qin Xingxuan and Mu Qianyu to was the Blood Slaughter Steppes – the Road of the Emperor.

With Steppes Master Lin Ming bringing them, there was certainly no one that would dare stop Qin Xingxuan and Mu Qianyu from entering the Road of the Emperor. Moreover, most of the Tower Masters and High Lords were controlled by Demonshine. In the future, the Blood Slaughter Steppes would become a great support for Divine Phoenix Island.

Qin Xingxuan and Mu Qianyu split up and went to two different Sky Split Towers, separately entering the Road of the Emperor. As for Lin Ming, he also entered and began to perceive the emperor stone tablets.

The road of the Emperor stone tablets were far inferior to the road of will lights in term of mysteriousness. The emperor stone tablets were carved with Laws that geniuses had left behind after they passed through the Road of the Emperor. Besides a few people like the Demon Emperor, none of these emperor stone tablets entered Lin Ming’s eyes. Even the highest of these emperor stone tablets were inferior to the exquisiteness of the Thunder Laws jade slip left behind by Jiang Ziji.

Lin Ming was a bit disappointed by this.

Empyrean Primordius and the goddess from the Eternal Demon Abyss had each left behind one will light, but they hadn’t left behind any emperor stone tablets. Lin Ming’s greatest harvest on the Road of the Emperor was from entering the grandmist space that Empyrean Primordius had left behind. He managed to form his grandmist battle spirit in a single go and even came into contact with the mystical Chaos Laws.

No such lucky chance existed in the road of the Emperor stone tablets.

For the next year, Lin Ming assisted Qin Xingxuan and Mu Qianyu in cultivating, passing their days in love and warmth.

During this year, Qin Xingxuan succeeded in breaking into the Revolving Core realm. Compared to Mu Qianyu who broke into the Revolving Core realm at 30 years of age, she was two years faster.

As for Mu Qianyu, she was at the peak of the late Revolving Core realm, just a single step away from Life Destruction. This was also because she felt her foundation and background were lacking, so she intentionally suppressed her cultivation. Otherwise she would’ve already broken through.

As for Lin Ming, he had used this year to thoroughly stabilize his cultivation and purify his understanding of Laws. He completely eliminated all hidden dangers left behind by the ridiculously rapid rise of his cultivation.

In spring a year later, on a clear sunny day, Lin Ming brought Mu Qianyu and Qin Xingxuan to Divine Phoenix Island’s Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm, where they entered the restricted zone.

Before Lin Ming entered the restricted zone, the Temple Spirit already felt his presence.

An old and indifferent voice echoed in his ear, “It’s been a long time, trial challenger.”

“Mm. It’s been a while. I apologize for disturbing Senior’s sleep. I came this time to ask you a question. How can I break through the space barrier of this world? I would like to leave the Sky Spill Continent and go to the Divine Realm.”

The Temple Spirit said, “Trial challenger, Lady Fairy Feng already investigated the situation around the Sky Spill Continent. The space-time around this planet has been blocked off by some mysterious power. If you wish to create a space channel out of this world and ascend to the Divine Realm then it’ll be very difficult. The simplest method is to go to another world through a transmission array, then take a space channel through there instead. When you left Timeworn Phoenix City, Lady Fairy Feng also passed you several jade slips. One of those jade slips has a single hair of Fairy Feng. If you crush this jade slip, that hair will turn into an incarnation of her. You can rely on this to speak to Lady Fairy Feng again. “

“Mm? That happened?” Lin Ming was stunned. He didn’t think that Fairy Feng would leave behind such a contingency plan. When he left Timeworn Phoenix City, Fairy Feng gave him several Fire Concept jade slips so that he could perceive them. He never discovered anything strange with them.

The Temple Spirit said, “Lady Fairy Feng and Guru Blueflame calculated that you have karma within the Sky Spill Continent that you have not yet resolved, and a greater destiny that you had yet to inherit. If you prematurely ascend to the Divine Realm then you will not be able to fully delve into your potential. Thus, they allowed you to return to the Sky Spill Continent.”

“However, a most elegant white dragon fish is still restrained by the fishermen and birds. Although you’re a mighty dragon in a deep pool and you also have Lady Fairy Feng’s appreciation, before you grow, your fate will inexorably be filled with layers upon layers of trials and tribulations. Without anyone protecting you, even if your destiny is potent, there still exists the danger that you will perish.”

“So Lady Fairy Feng spent a hundred years of her cultivation to keep her incarnation in her hair to accompany you. She didn’t inform you of this so that you wouldn’t grow an arrogant heart and display your true potential instead, reaching the peak of destiny in the Sky Spill Continent and settling your karmic ties. But if you truly did suffer an accident and your life was on the edge between life and death, this jade slip would automatically shatter and Lade Fairy Feng’s incarnation would appear, comprehensively and completely protecting you.”

“Because of the laws that limit the Sky Spill Continent, this incarnation wisp only has a cultivation suppressed to the peak of the late Divine Sea realm. Even so, the incarnation perfectly inherited Lady Fairy Feng’s understanding of Laws. For her to exterminate someone like the Sky Spill Continent’s highest under the heavens would be as simply as waving her hand.”

The Temple Spirit unhurriedly said. Lin Ming took a deep breath. He never imagined that Fairy Feng handled so many matters in secret.

With Fairy Feng’s boundary, let alone having her incarnation suppressed to the late Divine Sea realm, even if it were suppressed to the Life Destruction realm, that would be more than enough to annihilate Yang Yun. It had to be known that Lin Ming was only at the fifth stage of Life Destruction and he managed to kill Yang Yun. Cultivation wasn’t everything. If Fairy Feng’s true form were to arrive on this world, even if her cultivation was suppressed to the fourth stage of Life Destruction she would likely be able to defeat the fifth stage Life Destruction Lin Ming. That was the disparity brought along by different boundaries.

“I never thought that Senior Fairy Feng would make such arrangements. I, Lin Ming, will carve this kindness in my heart.”

Lin Ming honestly said. He knew he was currently an unimportant person. If he showed great talent, he could still only be considered a talented junior. When he obtained first place in the smelting trial, that was only in the lower realms’ Timeworn Phoenix City. The smelting trial in the Divine Realm was far more terrifying; there were simply far too many geniuses there.

A new batch of talents appeared every ten years or so and these extreme talents accumulated for tens of thousands of years. Even if he was the most outstanding talent of his generation, that didn’t mean he would achieve great accomplishments in the future.

With Fairy Feng’s status, she still painstakingly arranged such a protection for him. This was enough for Lin Ming to remember this kindness.

The Temple Spirit said, “Lady Fairy Feng has indeed taken great pains to help you, but you also did not disappoint. From when you returned until now, that wisp of incarnation has never been activated. This is proof that you perfectly resolved your karmic ties in the Sky Spill Continent. You can now choose any time you desire to ascend. Of course, don’t delay for too long. You already stand at the apex of the Sky Spill Continent. Your destiny in the lower realms has already reached its peak. The lower realms will only be your shackles. Only by continuing into the Divine Realm will you be able to broaden your horizons, seek greater lucky chances, meet stronger opponents, and soar into the heavens!”

“As for your cultivation being too low, you don’t need to worry about that. Martial artists born within the Divine Realm occupy the vast majority. They also start from body transformation and go step by step in their cultivations. Within the Ancient Phoenix Clan, there’s disciples at the Xiantian Realm and Revolving Core realm. Of course, there’s also disciples at the Divine Sea realm and Divine Transformation realm. The Ancient Phoenix Clan is an immensely large clan; it’s near impossible to count the number of clansmen. There’s probably billions, tens of billions, or even a hundred billion clansmen. Each and every single one of them have a high degree of cultivation talent. Even then, while the Ancient Phoenix Clan is massive, it’s insignificant in the face of the infinite Divine Realm.”

The Temple Spirit’s voice still lacked any emotion. These words made it clear just how vast and terrifying the Divine Realm really was. In terms of martial artists’ strength, even if all one billion worlds of the three thousands boundless universes were added together, it still couldn’t compare to the tiniest corner of the Divine Realm.

Lin Ming said, “Thank you Senior. This junior will spend another three months in the lower realms before officially ascending.”

“Everything is up to you.” The Temple Spirit’s voice faded away.

For the next three months, Lin Ming completely abandoned training. He brought his parents, Lin Xiaoge, Qin Xingxuan, and Mu Qianyu to sightsee, travelling all over the Sky Spill Continent.

These three months they rode high in the sky, looking down at the picturesque scenery. Sometimes they would disguise themselves as mortals, joining into the bustling marketplaces and experience the happiness and joy of common mortals. Other times they would spend money as if it were water. They would enjoy the most luxurious establishments in the world, savoring the high life of nobility.

During this tour, Lin Ming naturally drowned himself in the pleasures of Qin Xingxuan and Mu Qianyu, becoming drunk on their bodies. Every night they would make love until the lingering dawn approached, intoxicating themselves in the smell of each other. As the three month deadline approached, the two women also gave up any sense of shyness and propriety, allowing Lin Ming to hold them both at night and enjoy the blessings of two wives. They serviced Lin Ming together, all of them basking in love and bliss.

A long life, thousands of years of youth, carefree without worry, endless wealth, beautiful women that willingly ran into his arms, his every need taken care of. In this world, as long as he wished for it, it would be his. Such a life could be said to be at the highest peak.

But all good things had to come to an end. The happy times were far too short. The three month deadline finally arrived.

It was time for Lin Ming to ascend to the Divine Realm.

Chapter 949 – Towards the Divine Realm

…

…

…

Lin Ming took out the jade slip Fairy Feng left him and crushed it. For a while, countless dazzling lights formed in the sky, like a sea of fireflies had appeared. Space rippled and a red dressed woman seemingly appeared from nowhere. This woman was elegant and tied up her hair with a long hairpin. She looked at Lin Ming and smiled with appreciation.

“You have taken the initiative to crush the jade slip. Does this mean you have completed all matters before ascending to the Divine Realm?”

This wisp of Fairy Feng’s incarnation was no different from her true self. As she spoke her eyes fell on Mu Qianyu and Qin Xingxuan behind Lin Ming. She only needed to glance at them to guess the relationship between them and Lin Ming. If Lin Ming was ascending to the Divine Realm, these two women would naturally be Lin Ming’s worries.

“Yes, everything has been completed.” Lin Ming said.

“Good. For these past years in the Sky Spill Continent you’ve resolved your karmic ties without using the power that I left with you. You’ve reached the limit of your destiny and delved into the depths of your intention. Now, you may enter the Divine Realm without worry. In the future, you may return here and it can also be your true self that returns. When Empyrean Primordius left this barrier on the world, the truth is that it only affects those from the outside; it won’t block martial artists that originate from the Sky Spill Continent or Holy Demon Continent. Even if your future cultivation far surpasses the Divine Sea, you’ll still be able to come back to this planet.”

As Fairy Feng spoke Lin Ming was first startled, and then immediately overjoyed.

So that’s how it was. It seemed that the reason Empyrean Primordius left this seal behind was to prevent his enemies from the Divine Realm from entering the Sky Spill Continent and Holy Demon Continent. They might covet the Road of the Emperor, destroy the goddess’ true body, or steal the inheritances that he had left behind.

However, local martial artists that originated from the Sky Spill Continent and Holy Demon Continent didn’t have this restriction.

It seemed that tens of thousands of years ago the Sorcerer of the Southern Wilderness also returned with his true body instead of his incarnation. If it was truly just his incarnation then it would have been difficult to leave behind those incomparably complex and exquisite 72 Sorcerer Pagodas.

Fairy Feng said to Mu Qianyu and Qin Xingxuan, “You two have followed Lin Ming but now you must see your husband ascend, not knowing when he will return. That is a bit pitiful for you. I’ll bestow upon you two a lucky chance as compensation.”

Fairy Feng flicked her finger and two red balls of light sunk into Qin Xingxuan and Mu Qianyu’s body. Their bodies trembled for a brief moment and they felt as if they were lit on fire with endless energy rushing into them.

“These are flame seeds formed by three years of my cultivation and Ancient Phoenix blood; it also contains a fragment of Fire Laws. You can meditate on this and perceive it, melting it into your bodies as your train. This will assist you in breaking through to the eighth stage of Life Destruction and the late Divine Sea, giving you 10,000 years of life. That will bring you enough youthful vitality to wait for your husband’s return. At that time, Lin Ming will also help you cultivate and perhaps you may even reach the Divine Transformation realm, obtaining 30,000 years of life and everlasting youth.”

Mu Qianyu and Qin Xingxuan were ecstatic upon hearing Fairy Feng’s words. They rejoiced and hastily thanked her for her kindness. Which woman didn’t wish to be beautiful, which woman didn’t wish to have everlasting youth? With Fairy Feng’s boundary, just how precious was a flame seed formed by three years of her cultivation as well as her refined Ancient Phoenix blood? Moreover, the two of them also practiced fire-attribute cultivation methods, so melting this flame seed would be much easier for them.

If they could reach the Divine Transformation realm and obtain 30,000 years of youth, just what sort of concept was that? The change of a royal dynasty happened every few hundred years. 30,000 years was enough to see a dynasty change a hundred times. Countless emperors, princes, nobles, leaders, all of them would pass by like clouds. Even Divine Kingdoms would fall during this time.

But they would retain their youthful appearance and vigor. To a mortal, that was nearly immortality.

Fairy Feng thought for a moment, then tossed out several bottles filled with pills into Mu Qianyu’s hands. “These are spirit pills from the Divine Realm. They have mild effects. Among them are some fire-attribute pills that can help you break through boundaries, medicines that can help you wash your marrow and transform your body, and even some heavenly materials that can prolong a mortal’s life to a thousand years. Take them and do with them as you see fit.”

“Thank you fairy maiden.” Mu Qianyu bowed once more. These pills gifted by Fairy Feng were likely far more precious than the entirety of what Lin Ming left them.

“Good. Lin Ming, if you have anything else to say then speak up. If you do not, then come with me to the Divine Realm.”

“No. In place of my parents and family, this junior thanks Senior Fairy Feng.” Lin Ming said.

“Very well. Then, let’s go.”

Fairy Feng waved her sleeve and a bright crimson flame wrapped around Lin Ming. Lin Ming only felt slightly dizzy as countless streams of multicolored light rapidly passed by him. Lin Ming passed through space channels several times – this was clearly a space channel.

He was extremely shocked. Fairy Feng didn’t even use any array formations. She used her titanic supernatural powers to directly tear open the void and form this space channel!

“Senior Fairy Feng, you can actually shuttle through space by only relying on a late Divine Sea cultivation?” Lin Ming was floored. He defeated late Divine Sea level powerhouses and didn’t feel much awed by them. But now with a similar late Divine Sea cultivation presented in Fairy Feng, she was actually able to cross the void.

And during the time crossing the void, they were travelling to other worlds. This was shuttling through billions of miles; it was simply unimaginable!

Fairy Feng said, “This is the great void shift. It’s normally impossible to activate with a late Divine Sea cultivation, but I can make up for this difference with violet sun stones. The great void shift mainly relies on a martial artist’s comprehensions into the Space Laws; you need to reach at least the sixth level of Space Laws and comprehend Space Storm before being able to do this.”

Lin Ming had learned from Old Man Good Fortune that there were ten different levels in the Concept of Space.

They were: Space Distortion, Heaven’s Divide, Dimensional Slash, Space Disruption, Spatial Genesis, Space Storm, Black Hole Vortex, Tenth Space Dimension, World Destruction, and World Creation.

Old Man Good Fortune had given a detailed explanation of the first five levels.

Heaven’s Divide was to form a self-contained space, creating a defensive space all attacks would fail to reach.

Space Disruption was to use one’s will to disintegrate space, then use the scattered power of space offensively.

Spatial Genesis was to form an independent minor dimension. This minor dimension would have the five main elements. It would have air and it would have the ability to contain life. Upon reaching this step, one could forge magic tools like the Extreme Violet Ring.

As for the sixth level Space Storm, that was to seize control of space storms. Space storms were formed from the power of space. Taking control of a space storm was to master the power of space.

Upon reaching this level, a martial artist could casually tear open the void and enter a space crack. With just a thought, they could take complete control of the originally all-annihilating power of space within that space crack. A martial artist could wrap themselves in this space crack to travel forwards like a fish swimming in the water. This was the great void shift!

At this boundary, a martial artist could travel back and forth through the boundless universe with just a thought. They could travel 10 billion miles in just the blink of an eye!

Lin Ming never imagined that not only Fairy Feng’s comprehension into the Concept of Fire was extremely deep, but her comprehension into the Space Laws also reached at least the sixth level!

Fairy Feng realized Lin Ming’s thoughts and faintly smiled. “The power of Laws each have their own uses. Of course it’s great the deeper into Laws you’re able to comprehend, but sometimes it’s also good to not be greedy. If you focus on perceiving Laws too much, it’ll become an obstacle in your cultivation. There are some martial artists that have reached a very high boundary in cultivation but still haven’t managed to comprehend the sixth level of Space Laws. However, they can rely on some array formation magic tools to use great void shift.”

“Yes, this junior understands.” Lin Ming humbly said.

After an incense stick of time, the rainbow colored light around them disappeared. Lin Ming saw a sudden bright light and in the next moment he arrived within a grand hall. Rich fire origin energy was all around him; this was clearly no longer the world where the Sky Spill Continent was located.

It was impossible for Fairy Feng to break through the space barrier set up by Empyrean Primordius that divided the Sky Spill Continent’s planet and the Divine Realm. They could only go to other worlds before entering the Divine Realm.

In this grand hall, a red dressed woman was standing. This was Fairy Feng’s true form. The incarnation that led Lin Ming here turned into pure energy and flew into Fairy Feng’s body. This incarnation was originally formed by adding a hundred years of her cultivation to a single hair; she could naturally take it back whenever she wished.

“Let’s go. With your fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation, you will be hindered by the laws of the universe during your ascension to the Divine Realm. You’ll need me to personally bring you there. The space channel between the lower realm and the Divine Realm is filled with the power of heavenly retribution; it’s likely you’ll be scorched to ashes.”

“Yes. I must trouble Senior.”

Fairy Feng brought Lin Ming onto an altar. This red altar was completely carved with red flame jade. From the lower realm to the Divine Realm, the space was locked up by the laws of the universe. Even if a martial artist comprehended Space Storms and was able to freely use great void shift, they would still need to borrow the power of an array formation to ascend. It was impossible to tear apart that void.

Therefore, whether it was flying to the Divine Realm from the lower realms, or returning to the lower realms from the Divine Realm, neither option was easy. One had to pay a large price every trip. Normally, after a martial artist reached the Divine Realm they wouldn’t have the ability to return to the lower realms unless they cultivated to a high enough boundary and were able to afford the price.

The array formation activated and the dizzying feeling of transferring through space came over Lin Ming once again. Except this time was much more intense than the previous times. In front of Lin Ming countless beams of light formed together, forming a rainbow colored cloud. This was a retribution cloud and contained the power of heavenly retribution!”

For a Divine Sea martial artist to ascend to the Divine Realm was the rules of the Heavenly Dao. If one’s cultivation was lower than the Divine Sea, they would receive the impediment of the Heavenly Dao. The lower one’s cultivation was, the great this hindrance would be. If Lin Ming had decided to bring Qin Xingxuan with him, then even if Qin Xingxuan was hidden in the Extreme Violet Ring, she would still have to face the power of heavenly retribution and it would be even more powerful than what Lin Ming would have to face. Even Fairy Feng might not be able to block it.

Kacha!

Heavenly thunder turned into a surging purple dragon that shot towards Lin Ming. Since ancient times, thunder symbolized the power of heavenly retribution, and heavenly retribution normally expressed itself through the power of thunder.

Fairy Feng said, “Lin Ming, revolve your complete strength to resist this. Although I can scatter the thunder for you, there’s still a great deal of escaping energy that I cannot eliminate. Moreover, you must personally resist a part of this thunder tribulation, otherwise the heavenly retribution will only become increasingly formidable. I have some pills here. If you take them, they’ll increase your strength for some time and assist you in resisting the thunder tribulation.”

Fairy Feng flicked her finger and a red light fell into Lin Ming’s hand. At that same time, Fairy Feng struck her palm against that thunder dragon. Flames soared into the heavens, and behind Fairy Feng, a massive Ancient Phoenix phantom formed, wildly colliding with that purple thunder dragon.

Chapter 950 – Phoenix Cry Palace

…

…

…

With a ringing explosion, countless arcs of thunder and blazing flames surged outwards, blotting out the world!

Fairy Feng only needed a single attack to defeat the purple thunder dragon. It turned into a massive number of tiny specks of thunder energy that came falling over Lin Ming and Fairy Feng.

As Lin Ming saw this his mind stirred. He revolved the Heretical God Force and began to greedily absorb the tiny specks of thunder energy like a drunk in a wine cellar.

Within Lin Ming’s body, the Heretical God Sprout trembled underneath the nourishing thunder.

This was the power of heavenly retribution; it was different from the thunder of the mortal world. The inherent energy was extremely pure and was greatly beneficial towards Lin Ming.

“Eh?”

Fairy Feng glanced at Lin Ming with some surprise. She thought that Lin Ming would have some trouble resisting the thunder, but he seemed to be smoothly swallowing up the power of thunder tribulation instead. Not only was he not injured, he even seemed to be obtaining some benefits.

“Lin Ming, I didn’t think that you would also have such high achievements in the Concept of Thunder. It seems as if…” Fairy Feng’s thoughts stirred and she immediately covered Lin Ming within her divine sense. It seemed as if she could see through him.

“Not bad! Not bad at all!” Fairy Feng praised. “Your body, after passing through the tempering of Thunder Laws several times has already become a thunder-attribute spirit body. Every cell within your body is activated through the stimulation of thunder. It seems you have an extremely high compatibility with Thunder Laws! Did you temper your body within thunder energy when you crossed Life Destruction?”

Fairy Feng had amazing eyesight. She could immediately see where Lin Ming’s thunder-attribute spirit body came from.

“Senior has excellent vision. That is exactly the reason.” As Lin Ming spoke, Fairy Feng scattered another bolt of heavenly retribution thunder once more. The dispersed energy was completely absorbed by Lin Ming. As the two spoke, they resisted the power of heavenly retribution in a extremely relaxed manner.”

“Very good. But when you enter the Ancient Phoenix Clan you must focus your studies on the Concept of Fire. The Thunder Concepts are mainly concentrated in the Thunder Dragon branch of the Ancient Dragon Clan. There’s also the Ancient Kirin Clan’s Electric Violet Kirin branch. My Ancient Phoenix Clan doesn’t have any great inheritances for the Concept of Thunder. You have passed the first five stages of Life Destruction by tempering your body in thunder, but from this point on you must temper your body within fire energy instead! This will allow your body to reach the extremes of thunderfire compatibility!”

Another bolt of divine thunder was split apart by Fairy Feng. She diverted 70% of this thunder energy and let the remaining 30% flow towards Lin Ming.

Lin Ming’s pupils shrank. His mind touched upon the Heretical God Sprout and he began to crackle as he prepared to withstand this bolt of thunder.

Kacha!

Lin Ming’s protective true essence shattered and the power of thunder violently surged into him, crashing left and right as it rushed through his meridians. It reached the Heretical God Sprout, and as it did, Lin Ming felt his entire body go numb. But he was also inexplicably comfortable; he couldn’t help but shout out loud.

“Good! Very good!”

Fairy Feng nodded. She linked her hands together and continued to split apart the incoming thunder. From diverting 70% of the heavenly retribution thunder, it became 60%, 50%, and then 40%, with Lin Ming having to withstand more and more of the power of heavenly retribution. His body was filled to the brim with energy as if he would burst apart at any moment. Suddenly, the Heretical God Sprout unexpectedly stretched out a little bud; the fourth leaf was about to grow!

The Heretical God Sprout successfully formed the third leaf only after absorbing the Purple Lion Thunder Source as well as accumulating a massive amount of thunder energy beforehand. But the fourth leaf was beginning to form only after absorbing the power of heavenly retribution which hadn’t even condensed into a Thunder Soul or Thunder Source. It could be seen that heavenly retribution thunder was superior to an ordinary Thunder Source.

The current Heretical God Sprout now had four leaves. Three of them were thunder leaves and only a single one was a fire leaf. But this wasn’t a problem. After Lin Ming entered the Ancient Phoenix Clan, the number of fire leaves would likely far surpass the thunder leaves.

The power of heavenly retribution became increasingly intense. Fairy Feng repeatedly blocked in the front, but afterwards, it wasn’t just thunder, but also round dao diagrams! These were the rules of the Heavenly Dao. They naturally formed dao diagrams in space.

As Lin Ming saw this, he felt the terrifying strength exuding from the dao diagrams. He sucked in a deep breath. He thought that with his own thunder spirit body, once his cultivation rose he might even be able to resist the Heavenly dao and freely travel between the Divine Realm and the lower realms. But now it seemed that he was far too na?ve in his expectations. These dao diagrams were too terrifying; if he bumped into one then he’d be reduced to ashes.

Fairy Feng’s expression turned solemn. She lifted both her arms and a side world formed around him. This was the projection of Fairy Feng’s inner world. Facing this Heavenly Dao, she couldn’t help but wholeheartedly project her inner world.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Dao diagram after dao diagram was shattered by Fairy Feng with countless Law fragments bursting apart. This fierce collision continued for half an hour but Fairy Feng’s strength seemed to be unlimited; her supernatural powers didn’t weaken in the slightest.

After an hour passed, the last circular dao diagram was blocked by Fairy Feng. Lin Ming felt a brightness in front of him. The rainbow colored power of space around him vanished and he arrived in the air above a great world.

The skies above were vast and limitless, and the earth beneath him extended to eternity. The mountains below him seemed as small as sand and the rivers appeared like strands of silk. Lin Ming guessed that he was several thousand miles above the ground, but even though he was so high up, the ground beneath him had no end. This sort of scene was startling.

An earthshaking roar suddenly filled the air. He looked up and saw a thousand mile long ancient vicious beast flying through the skies. The ancient vicious beast had massive wings and a ferocious appearance. The pressure that it emitted was bewildering. Lin Ming could clearly feel that he was in no way a match for this vicious beast.

This was the Divine Realm?

Lin Ming took a deep breath. He discovered that the heaven and earth origin energy here wasn’t pure like he had imagined. Rather, it was mixed and violent!

Five elemental energy, pure yang energy, extreme yin energy, life energy, blood demon energy, ghost energy, demon essence; a multitude of energies together, overbearing and brutal!

As he sucked in a deep breath of this energy, Lin Ming immediately felt the violet energies break into his meridians like wild horses. Of course, Lin Ming’s boundary reached Life Destruction so suppressing this energy was easy. But for a martial artist at the body transformation realm or some other low level boundary, they might not have the ability to withstand this energy.

To use this energy to cultivate, one had to separate and purify it. If one wasn’t careful during training then it was even possible to fall into madness.

“Divine Realm martial artists actually grow up in such an environment…” Lin Ming said, a bit dumbfounded. This kind of heaven and earth origin energy raised the threshold for those that could cultivate martial arts. Many martial artists with lower talents would not even have the qualifications to begin cultivating, otherwise, they might mess up the flow of energy in their meridians and die.

But for those martial artists with extraordinary talent, because they breathed in this violent heaven and earth origin energy since birth, their training was tempered and their strength was even more formidable!

Fairy Feng sensed what Lin Ming was thinking. She said, “The environment in the Divine Realm is much more brutal than the lower realms. Here is the true law of the jungle. Here, strength is not everything, strength is the only thing. Here, the competition is far more intense, and the fate of those who are eliminated is also far more miserable. You must know that a martial artist lives for a long time, and they have numerous descendants. Because of this, the population growth here is exponential. But no matter how broad and vast the Divine Realm is, the resources are still limited. It’s impossible for the Divine Realm to bear such a increasingly massive population. Moreover, not every family clan has the ability to send the overflow of their clansmen to the lower realms. Here, the result of losing is often death.”

Lin Ming sucked in a breath of cold air. Indeed, if a martial artist lived for several thousand years or even 10,000 years, it wouldn’t be strange if they had several hundred children. Most of these children would likely practice martial arts too, with a similarly long life. And their children would have children, continuing on and on. The population of a family clan would grow at ridiculous rates. One wouldn’t even need 10 generations for a single person to produce hundreds of thousands or even millions of descendants.

The Divine Realm existed for countless billions of years. If death wasn’t overwhelmingly common, then no matter how large the Divine Realm was, it would be packed full with people.

This was a cruel world!

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to Phoenix Cry Palace. My Ancient Phoenix Clan has a total of three great family clans and seventy two palaces, all of them located on different worlds in the Divine Realm. In addition, there’s also the independent Ice Phoenix Clan. They have a total of 36 palaces. The Ice Phoenix Clan tends to live in the extreme polar regions of worlds as well as worlds of snow and ice and other hidden worlds. They don’t reach out to the outside world often and they also aren’t managed by us. Even though the Ancient Phoenix Clan has a true total of 108 palaces, the number referred to is usually the 72 Fire Phoenix Palaces. I’m from Phoenix Cry Palace and am also the 69th seated disciple of the Phoenix Cry Palace’s Palace Master.”

“Uh. 69th disciple?” Lin Ming repeated, his mouth hanging open. In his impression, Fairy Feng’s strength was extremely overbearing; he feared that she was no weaker than a character like the Demon Emperor. This impressive character was only the 69th disciple of Phoenix Cry Palace? And the Ancient Phoenix Clan had a total of 107 other palaces that were similar to Phoenix Cry Palace? Just how many masters were there?

Fairy Feng sensed Lin Ming’s thoughts. She said, “The Phoenix Cry Palace Master has a total of 81 disciples; he gathered nine groups of nine disciples. And these 81 disciples also have varying levels of strength. The strongest amongst them that stand out are only 5-6 individuals, and these people are called the Vice Palace Masters. I’m one of the Vice Palace Masters of Phoenix Cry Palace.”

“I see…” Lin Ming nodded. He found this much easier to accept.

As Fairy Feng spoke, she brought Lin Ming and tore apart the void again, using the great void shift once more. The space of the Divine Realm was extremely stable; it was countless times more difficult to tear space here as opposed to the lower realms. With Lin Ming’s strength, his casual attack could shatter space in the Sky Spill Continent, but in the Divine Realm, his strongest attack was barely able to distort space.

After an incense stick of time, Fairy Feng broke through space and appeared above an endless sea. The seawater was unexpectedly a gold color. Looking at this dazzling sea of gold from afar, this sight was beautiful and mesmerizing.

Lin Ming looked all around but couldn’t see so much as a shadow of Phoenix Cry Palace.

Fairy Feng formed a seal. The space in front of Lin Ming suddenly twisted, extending outwards like ripples in the water.

A several hundred foot gap appeared in space. And through this space gap, Lin Ming could see a world. A world hidden in the void; a world that was created by an overwhelming supernatural power. Phoenix Cry Palace was actually hidden in this world!

It had to be said that the space within the Divine Realm was extremely stable. For someone to split open and create a great world here, Lin Ming found it difficult to imagine just what level of character that must have been.

Chapter 951 – Contention

…

…

…

Casting out his divine sense to the limit, he wasn’t able to sense the boundaries of this world. All he saw were billowing clouds, endless celestial mountains, immortal islands, and heavenly cave dwellings; this entire world was a paradise.

Floating amongst the clouds were countless spirit birds and spirit beasts. The spirit beasts rolled about in the air, many of them hundreds of miles long, some even a thousand miles long. Lin Ming could even see a sea serpent dragon in the distance, the same sort that had emitted the sea serpent gas in the 8000 Mile Black Swamp, the same sort of sea serpent dragon whose gas could form sea serpent crystals!

Phoenix Cry Palace’s sea serpent dragon was over a thousand miles long, and its immense body was draped over a massive mountain range. It sprayed out ridiculous amounts of gas, but this gas was actually different from the black corrosive poison in the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. Rather, this gas formed rainbow colored clouds, beautiful and auspicious.

Besides the sea serpent dragon were golden crows, flame birds, vermillion birds, and many other birds and beasts of all colors that resembled phoenixes. All of them soared through the skies between heaven and earth; Lin Ming looked at this scene, awestruck.

These celestial mountains, immortal islands, endless clouds over an infinite sea, fairy birds, spirit beasts, and this world that was created within the void, all of this was shocking. Who cared about the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom or Demon God Imperial Palace? Those quasi-sixth grade and sixth grade sects of the Sky Spill Continent were nothing more than little uncivilized bumpkin villages compared to the massive metropolis of the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s Phoenix Cry Palace.

Fairy Feng calmly brought Lin Ming into Phoenix Cry Palace. A 7-8 mile high five-colored bird immediately flew in front of Fairy Feng and prostrated itself before her.

This five-colored bird looked like a phoenix and also like a vermillion bird. Compared to this spirit bird, the vermillion birds of Divine Phoenix Island were nothing more than little chickens. Not even mentioning aura and pressure, just their size was unbelievable. This five-colored bird was 7-8 miles tall, but the vermillion birds of Divine Phoenix Island were only 70-80 feet tall; they just couldn’t be compared.

Alas, nothing could be done about this. The current vermillion birds of the Sky Spill Continent were distant remnants of ancient birds that were inoculated with the blood of the Ancient Phoenix. Although the blood of the Ancient Phoenix had extremely mystical properties, several drops alone wasn’t enough to allow these birds to reach the Divine Sea realm in strength. Moreover, the Sky Spill Continent’s Ancient Phoenix Clan was extinguished 100,000 years ago. With no one to raise the vermillion birds, weed out the weak from their bloodline and further fuse Ancient Phoenix blood into them, after 100,000 years, those ancient vermilion birds bred with common birds, diluting their bloodline repeatedly until it was a faint shadow of the past. Now, they no longer had their past glory.

When Divine Phoenix Island was established, if a vermillion bird were to grow up they would reach an extreme Xiantian cultivation. If they could train some more, it would already be impressive for them to reach the late Revolving Core realm.

A few drops of Ancient Phoenix blood, after passing through the weakening of 100,000 years, just how much could there possibly be left?

This was the difference of inheritances. There was no comparing those vermillion birds to this five-colored bird in front of him.

Fairy Feng and Lin Ming stepped onto the five-colored bird. The bird spread its vast wings and soared into the skies, passing through layers upon layers of celestial mountains and immortal islands. After fifteen minutes, Lin Ming finally saw a titanic palace looming in front of him. This palace’s dimensions were beyond belief; it simply looked like a small planet!

It was even possible that this palace was forged from a planet by a top Supreme Elder.

Lin Ming was deeply shocked. But thinking about it some more, this was also normal. The normal Ancient Phoenix Clan was comprised of three great family clans and 72 palaces. Each palace held several hundred million or even a billion Ancient Phoenix clansmen. With so many people, how could this palace possibly hold them if it wasn’t the size of a planet?

Fairy Feng brought Lin Ming towards Phoenix Cry Palace. As they said, a mountain in the distance could run a horse dead. Even though Lin Ming could see Phoenix Cry Palace in front of him, and the speed of the multicolored spirit birds and beasts were at thousands of miles in the blink of an eye, they still flew for a long time before arriving at Phoenix Cry Palace.

As they neared Phoenix Cry Palace, Lin Ming could finally sense just how immense it was. Even the 7 to 8 mile five-colored bird he rode on was nothing more than a tiny speck of dust in front of this massive palace!

Within this palace, there were countless great jade temples and pagodas. Above the palace, there were nine great suns floating in the air, each of them showing a vague golden crow within.

Nine golden crows, nine suns in space!

Lin Ming very much suspected that the nine suns in the sky were evolved from the nine golden crow saint beasts. Phoenix Cry Palace was a true immortal paradise!

Approaching Phoenix Cry Palace, he could see countless Ancient Phoenix Clan disciples shuttling back and forth on spirit birds and spirit beasts. There were endless saint beasts and spirit boats flying about.

Many people bowed as they saw Fairy Feng. As one of Phoenix Cry Palace’s Vice Palace Masters, she naturally enjoyed an extremely high status.

As Fairy Feng was about to bring Lin Ming down towards Phoenix Cry Palace, the sounds of heavenly music resounded in the air. Lin Ming looked up to see a massive ship carved in the form of a golden eagle, pulled by nine crimson sun birds, slowly flying towards them.

Around this large ship were 72 heavenly women flying, each of them slender and beautiful, fragrant and alluring. They carried various instruments, ribbons, flower vases, or art pieces, while chatting. Heavenly music lingered around them, making the scene look like an emperor was going out on a trip.

This large ship stopped in front of Fairy Feng. A thick curtain of divine silk was pulled open and a handsome man stepped out, holding a beautiful woman in his arms. He smiled at Fairy Feng from the great ship.

“I was wondering who it was, so it was Junior-apprentice Sister Yan.”

The man lazily spoke to Fairy Feng, not even sparing a glance at Lin Ming. This man referred to Fairy Feng by her surname. Fairy Feng’s surname was Yan, and her full name was Yan Fengxian. Fairy Feng was only a title.

Lin Ming could feel the aura and surging momentum from this man’s body, as if a sleeping volcano was sealed within his body, absolutely terrifying. This man was another Divine Realm Supreme Elder that surpassed his understandings.

However, from this man’s posture, he didn’t seem to be on good relations with Fairy Feng.

As Lin Ming was thinking of this, Fairy Feng’s eyebrow arched up. She coldly smiled and said, “Sun Yanming? What do you want? Thirty years ago you ate a Flame Yang Pill and borrowed the World Returning Divine Furnace Xiao Jiuyang to cultivate. You even used a time shifting array to slow time down, taking one year as ten years. You closed up for 30 years, but in fact that was equal to 300 years. For such a long time, you still haven’t managed to make a breakthrough? Not only is your cultivation the same as it was 30 years ago, but your true essence isn’t any thicker at all. You’re truly a waste of resources!”

Fairy Feng’s words left Lin Ming secretly flabbergasted. He never thought that Fairy Feng would have such a fierce side to her. Facing her enemy, her words sharply confronted him, harsh and contentious.

Fairy Feng’s words were obviously meant to poke at Sun Yanming’s sore spots. His complexion turned ugly as he was unable to refute her words. Sun Yanming glanced at Lin Ming and suddenly smiled, appearing much happier. He thought that Lin Ming was Fairy Feng’s attendant, but now he discovered something interesting about him.

“You’re a martial artist that ascended from the lower realms?”

Sun Yanming immediately saw through Lin Ming’s status. The most significant difference between a Divine Realm martial artist and a lower realms martial artist was the true essence within their bodies. A Divine Realm martial artist cultivated with violent and mixed heaven and earth origin energy, making the energy within their bodies much more brutal and powerful; it wouldn’t be so calm and gentle like the energy within a lower realms martial artist.

“To ascend with a fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation, haha, you must have an unrivalled powerhouse who formed their own inner world as your protector to do so, otherwise you would be reduced to ashes by the explosive power of the heavenly retribution. No wonder, so it was Junior-apprentice Sister Yan who took a trip to the lower realms, consuming a massive amount of violet sun stones in order to bring you up? That’s quite strange. A lower realms martial artist is actually held in such high esteem by Junior-apprentice Sister Yan, to the point she would bring you here?”

“Could it be that Junior-apprentice Sister Yan knows that she has no one to support her here in the sect and that it’s impossible for her to compare with Senior-apprentice Brother Jiuyang? Does she want to establish her own forces and picked you up, the little baby boy, to do so?”

Sun Yanming intentionally bit out the words ‘little baby boy’, the mocking tone thick in his voice. Indeed, with his boundary, a fifth stage Life Destruction martial artist that ascended from the lower realms was indeed only a little baby boy. “Junior-apprentice Sister Yan, do you really plan on waiting for the lower realms martial artists to grow up and support you? Haha! Junior-apprentice Sister Yan, I must say, don’t you think your plan of relying on these lower realms martial artists is a bit too na?ve?”

Sun Yanming rubbed his chin, sizing up Lin Ming and also wantonly piercing through him with his perception, seeing through his body. This was extremely rude behavior. Lin Ming tried as hard as he could to prevent this divine sense, but there simply wasn’t anything he could to do stop it.

“Haha, what a handsome young boy toy, he really is good material for a cute little gigolo.”

Sun Yanming exposed a disdainful smile, his meaning apparent. But his words actually angered Fairy Feng. A cold light flashed in Fairy Feng’s eyes, and in less than 1/100,000 of an instant, a light misty blue light shot out from Fairy Feng’s eyes and thrust into Sun Yanming’s body. Sun Yanming shook as something painful happened to him. His features twisted and he backed away, his face whitening.

This glance also interrupted Sun Yanming’s perception so that Lin Ming didn’t have to resist that powerful pressure anymore.

It was obvious that Sun Yanming was far inferior to Fairy Feng in strength, otherwise he wouldn’t have been forced back by a simple glance.

“That’s a battle spirit?” Lin Ming was startled. Everything had happened in a flash. He only managed to speculate that it was a battle spirit from the brief flash of light, and moreover, it was absolutely above a gold battle spirit!

Once one reached a gold battle spirit their will would be able to directly project onto reality and affect the real world, multiplying the strength of a battle spirit. Fairy Feng had obviously superseded this boundary.

The higher boundary a battle spirit was, the greater impact it would have on one’s combat strength. Now, Fairy Feng had relied on just her battle spirit to have Sun Yanming eat a loss.

Lin Ming was a bit surprised. He thought that if this Sun Yanming was mocking Fairy Feng, then he should have strength at least equal to hers; he didn’t think the disparity would be so great. Did he have backing behind him? Was it that Senior-apprentice Brother Jiuyang? If he obviously opposed someone stronger than him without someone propping him up from behind then that was just seeking death.

As Lin Ming was thinking, Yan Fengxian sent out a red beam of light that wrapped around Lin Ming. She coldly said, “We’re leaving!”

Yan Fengxian disappeared like a bolt of lightning, leaving behind the gloomy Sun Yanming. Sun Yanming took out a soul recovery pill and swallowed it, his eyes flashing with a tint of fear and malice.

“Yan Fengxian, you’re ruthless! I’ll wait for the day that Senior-apprentice Brother Yang becomes the Phoenix Cry Palace Master, and on that day, you’ll be finished. When that day comes, I will rip off your proud and haughty exterior and humiliate you!”

Chapter 952 – Nine Divine Shifts

…

…

…

Led by Fairy Feng, Lin Ming flew on the five-colored bird towards Phoenix Cry Palace at lightning speed. A strong heavenly wind blew past Fairy Feng, sending her hair recklessly waving in the air. Lin Ming stood behind her, silent.

“Do you have some questions in your heart that you would like to ask?” Fairy Feng asked.

“I do have some questions, but it seems they are power struggles between the upper level figures of Phoenix Cry Palace so they don’t have much to do with me,” Lin Ming calmly said. His current boundary was simply too low. These high level power struggles of Phoenix Cry Palace didn’t have much of a connection to him.

“Simply because you don’t think you’re related doesn’t mean you aren’t. What is relevant to you will be relevant to you. Lin Ming, you are someone that I hold in high esteem, and as someone that I brought to Phoenix Cry Palace, you can be considered my person. As someone who is on my side, I can naturally provide you resources. But at the same time, you will also have to face many enemies.”

“Phoenix Cry Palace has a total of nine great Vice Palace Masters, the first of them being Vice Palace Master Sage Jiuyang, also known as Xiao Jiuyang. He is from one of the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s three great family clans, the Xiao Family Clan. He has been a disciple longer than I have, and his talent is extraordinary. He has experienced many fortuitous encounters, and is extremely strong. He has a massive amount of personal connections in the sect, and he is also ridiculously rich, to the point where he can toss away resources like they’re nothing. There’s many talented disciples, Palace Elders, and Hall masters that have received benefits from him. Many matters of Phoenix Cry Palace are also handled by him. Every year, the rising stars amongst the new disciples almost all follow him as subordinates. It can be said that within Phoenix Cry Palace, Xiao Jiuyang’s words are as good as law. When the Palace Master goes into seclusion, Xiao Jiuyang often manages many of the important matters.”

“The Palace Master will soon resign from his position, just another few hundred years. At that time, he’ll go to the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s core Heaven Phoenix Palace to enter closed door cultivation, and the struggle for the position of Palace Master will begin in earnest. Out of the nine great Vice Palace Masters, one of us will be chosen, and out of all of us, Xiao Jiuyang has the highest chances of winning.”

As Fairy Feng spoke, Lin Ming immediately became aware of what was happening. This power struggle of authority was for the position of the Palace master. In the mortal world, when a Crown Prince struggled for the throne, they could sacrifice family and friends. The Vice Palace Masters of Phoenix Cry Palace were neither family nor friends. In the Divine Realm where strength was worshipped and respected above all, the power struggles would be even more ruthless.

Lin Ming asked, “Senior Fairy Feng, do you plan on struggling for the position of Phoenix Cry Palace Master?”

“Of course. Why wouldn’t I struggle? As someone who walks the road of martial arts, the most important goal in my life is cultivation. Without cultivation, everything else is hollow. In order to increase my cultivation, I’ll need massive lucky chances. Becoming the Phoenix Cry Palace Master is such a massive lucky chance. If I become the Phoenix Cry Palace Master, I’ll be able to control this divine palace and freely move resources as I see fit. The treatment and resources enjoyed by the Palace Master cannot be compared to others. Of the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s 72 palaces, each Palace Master commands their own land and receives the help of the Ancient Phoenix Clan. Not just that, but everyone will ride on your coattails. Those that earnestly followed you will be able to enjoy good fortune, and as for those that worked against you, they’ll suffer miserable fates.”

“The man you just saw is called Sun Yanming. Although he is my senior, his strength is limited and he isn’t even a Vice Palace Master. He flatters Xiao Jiuyang because he thinks that he will obtain benefits after Xiao Jiuyang becomes the Palace Master.

Fairy Feng thoroughly explained the situation to Lin Ming. Whether it was emperors of the mortal world, or Palace Masters of the Divine Realm, one had to have the support of others to struggle for status. If the entire Phoenix Cry Palace was willing to support someone, then the other Vice Palace masters couldn’t struggle for the position even if they wanted to.

Fairy Feng started late and the moment when the Palace Master would resign was just several hundred years away. She had to cultivate her own troops to help her resist Xiao Jiuyang; it was natural for her to value Lin Ming so highly.

Lin Ming became clear on what was happening. Regardless of what his own attitude on the matter was, in the hearts of everyone else he had already joined Fairy Feng’s side. But this result wasn’t too bad. In a place where the factions were distinct, it was best to join one of them. Trying to maintain a neutral stance and fish for benefits from both sides was impossible. He would just receive a cold shoulder from both factions and obtain no resources at all.

Moreover, the reason that he could ascend to the Divine Realm with just a fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation was all thanks to Fairy Feng helping him. According to Sun Yanming, she had to consume a massive amount of violet sun stones to help him ascend from the lower realms. Not just that, but she had even helped raise Mu Qianyu and Qin Xingxuan’s cultivation, and had even left behind an emergency life-saving jade slip.

Lin Ming certainly remembered all of these benevolences. If it weren’t for Fairy Feng, Lin Ming would have had to wait until he reached the Divine Sea to ascend and that’d be a great waste of time.

In this world there were no good intentions without reason nor were there bad intentions with no reason. Even if Fairy Feng had a motive behind her actions, Lin Ming would still repay her kindness.

After understanding all this, Lin Ming said, “I thank Senior for the high appraisal. This junior won’t disappoint Senior.”

“Mm, good! If you follow me, I won’t treat you unjustly. Come, I’ll take you to get a status badge as well as give you some violet sun stones and jade slips.”

Fairy Feng brought Lin Ming to the Burning Sun Hall. This was a 1000 feet grand hall at the edge of Phoenix Cry Palace. After stepping into this flame colored grand hall, Lin Ming could feel a rich and savage flame aura blowing towards him.

There were already many disciples here waiting in line. All of them were new disciples to the Phoenix Cry Palace. There were many of them that had ascended from the lower realms like Lin Ming. But unlike Lin Ming, they all had a Divine Sea realm cultivation.

Just that group of people had over 200 individuals, and the overall line was over two miles long. It wasn’t strange when one realized how many people were gathered here. It had to be known that Phoenix Cry Palace was less of a palace and more of a planet. This was a great world with several hundred million people living here. Amongst these several hundred million people, the vast majority of them were at the Revolving Core realm or below. They weren’t disciples of Phoenix Cry Palace, but rather martial artists that diligently trained every year, going through all sorts of harsh inspections in hopes of being promoted to a disciple. There was always a great number of new disciples at Phoenix Cry Palace.

In the Sky Spill Continent, those that reached Life Destruction were extremely powerful, and those that reached the Divine Sea could rule over their own side of the world. But in Phoenix Cry Palace, the Life Destruction and Divine Sea realms were only the lowest basic requirements to apply for being a formal disciple.

When Lin Ming arrived he immediately attracted the attention of many people, especially since he was being escorted by Fairy Feng. Although they didn’t know she was a Vice Palace Master, they could faintly feel just how terrifyingly formidable she was. And yet, such a character was leading a new disciple to obtain his status badge. Compared to all of them that had lined up here, the treatment was clearly different.

“Who is he?”

“I don’t recognize him. He should be someone that ascended from the lower realms though. I wonder which clan he came from.”

“Does he have special connections? Otherwise, how could he possibly trouble such a great person to lead him? He doesn’t even need to wait in line!” A martial artist who also ascended from the lower realms grumpily said. He could only watch as Fairy Feng brought Lin Ming to the front of the line to obtain his status badge, while he himself was already waiting here all day.

“Humph, what connections could he possibly have? If he had connections, why would he go to the lower realms? He would’ve already been enjoying himself in the Divine Realm! I think that he must have offered some great treasure. Every year tens of thousands of new disciples enter Phoenix Cry Palace, I wonder just how many of them think to offer up some sort of treasure.”

It wasn’t known which martial artist said this, but everyone suddenly felt this made sense. They began to regret that they themselves didn’t bring their own treasures. But then again, it wasn’t simple to take out a treasure that could tempt the heart of a Divine Realm powerhouse.

Another martial artist jealously remarked, “I have no idea what good thing that brat picked up, but humph, it’s stupid of him to give it away. Those that cultivate martial arts should focus on themselves, since when can others help you? If he finds a lucky chance, it’s best to keep it for himself to use. I bet that brat won’t last more than a few years.”

Lin Ming ignored the envious stares of those around him. He obtained his status plate. Looking at it, he could see that there was a golden crow spreading its wings engraved into the front, and the words “Lin Ming Command” carved into the back.

Lin Ming came from the Sky Spill Continent’s Nuyan Family Clan, so he should be named Nuyan Ming. However, he felt that this name was a bit awkward so he decided to use his given name instead. In any case, the Ancient Phoenix Clan only looked at one’s bloodline; the surname was just for recording purposes.

Normally, a disciple that just joined would have to perform a variety of chores. For instance, guarding, mining, tending to the medicine garden, and so on. But because of his relationship with Fairy Feng, he was exempt from this mandatory service.

Moreover, this was different from the Fire Crow Command that ordinary disciples received; this was the higher level Golden Crow Command.

According to their rank, Phoenix Cry Palace disciples were divided into four different halls. These were Firebird Hall, Golden Crow Hall, Vermillion Bird Hall, and Phoenix Hall.

Lin Ming should have entered the lowest level Firebird Hall, but because of Fairy Feng, he directly entered Golden Crow Hall. If his future results were extraordinary, he would be able to rise up and enter Vermillion Bird Hall, and finally set his sights on Phoenix Hall.

From bottom to top, every hall had a massive disparity in treatment. Lin Ming certainly wanted to enter Phoenix Hall as soon as possible. He couldn’t help but ask Fairy Feng, “Senior Fairy Feng, how do I enter Phoenix Hall?”

Fairy Feng was already expecting Lin Ming to ask this. She explained, “There are two ways. The first is to reach Divine Transformation. You’ll then obtain the qualifications to enter Phoenix Hall. After you pass the entrance examination, you’ll be able to enter Phoenix Hall. But this examination is extremely strict. There’s many people that cannot pass it even after reaching the Divine Transformation realm.”

“And the second way?” Lin Ming wanted to enter Phoenix Hall earlier, the Divine Transformation realm seemed a bit distant to him at the moment.

Fairy Feng replied, “The second way is a bit more difficult. That is to reach the ninth stage of Life Destruction. If you do, you can directly enter Phoenix Hall without need for any examination.”

“Oh? The ninth stage of Life Destruction!” Lin Ming was stunned. This was quite the shortcut. From the way it sounded, even in the Ancient Phoenix Clan a ninth stage Life Destruction martial artist was quite rare.

The Divine Realm’s top talents were powerful, enjoying top resources and the guidance of World Kings. But these talents were only in the tiny minority. How many World Kings could there be, and how many top resources were there to be divided?

The Divine Realm had many people, and the average person was stronger than the average person from the lower realms, but they were far from being comparably with Lin Ming.

Lin Ming was confident he could reach the ninth stage of Life Destruction.

Fairy Feng saw Lin Ming’s eyes flash and she understood what he was thinking. She laughed and said, “Not bad. Indeed, you must break into the ninth stage of Life Destruction, otherwise you’ll meet a bottleneck at the Divine Lord realm.”

“After Life Destruction are the three great realms of Divine Sea, Divine Transformation, and Divine Lord. Each of these three large boundaries are divided into three small boundaries of early, middle, and late stages. Three small boundaries within three large boundaries, that is a total of nine. Every martial artist that walks the road of martial arts must ‘journey towards Ninefall for the Nine Divine Shifts’.”

“Journey towards Ninefall means to reach the ninth stage of Life Destruction, and completely transform your mortal born body into a spirit body. Without crossing the ninth stage of Life Destruction, it will be extremely difficult to complete the ‘Nine Divine Shifts’.”

Chapter 953 – Saint Artifact Pavilion

…

…

…

“The Divine Sea boundary is the first step onto your road of becoming a god. Your dantian opens up to form a minor dimension, able to accommodate true essence as your dantian becomes a sea. Divine Transformation falls upon the word ‘transformation’. It’s where you evolve the world within your dantian to a dimensional realm. Finally, the Divine Lord realm is to truly become a god. A true world will evolve within your dantian and you will be able to sustain endless true essence. In addition, this world can even hold people, forests, lakes, seas, rivers, countries, and even stars! You can contain a massive number of your subjects in the world. When that happens, you shall be the god that they all believe in, you shall be their Divine Lord! That’s why this boundary is named the Divine Lord boundary; it’s to truly become a god.”

“If you can cross the nine stages of Life Destruction, that doesn’t necessarily mean you will become a Divine Lord. But after reaching the Divine Lord realm you won’t encounter endless bottlenecks and your potential will be far greater.”

Lin Ming was intrigued by the explanation given to him by Fairy Feng.. In truth, when he inherited the memories of the Ancient Devil, he became aware of the Divine Sea, Divine Transformation, and Divine Lord boundaries. But the Ancient Devil only knew that the Divine Lord boundary could contain forests and lakes. As for containing stars and even evolving the dantian into a great world that could contain countless people to live there, this was the first time Lin Ming heard of this.

According to Fairy Feng’s description, this world could have countries, farms, wars, sacrifices, life and death, joy and sorrow, the emotions of passing time, countless stories and legends all being staged simultaneously; it’d be like a country in the Sky Spill Continent. There could even be martial artists that cultivated, using the heaven and earth origin energy that the Divine Lord would pour into their body’s great world.

If they obtained a lucky chance they could even cultivate to the Divine Sea realm! Of course, compared to a martial artist that grew up in a true boundless universe, their difficulties would be multiplied many times.

A martial artist would become a divine god of their own inner world, with the worship of countless people. When they fought, they would even have the support of an entire great world’s origin energy; just how powerful would that be?

It was almost impossible to imagine!

That was a true and tested Divine Lord.

Fairy Feng said, “Alright. Lin Ming, I have already informed your situation to Jun Yunrue. She is one of my people and will guide you to your own dwelling. Here is a jade talisman; you can use it to contact me if you wish. I hope that you will soon enter Phoenix Hall.”

Fairy Feng flicked a spatial ring directly into Lin Ming’s hands. Lin Ming swept his divine sense through the spatial ring and found that it contained not only a jade talisman to contact Fairy Feng, but also a massive amount of purple colored divine stones and a complete set of jade slips. Without a doubt, these were violet sun stones and the jade slips were fire-attribute cultivation methods and Concept of Fire jade slips.

This was obviously special treatment she gave only Lin Ming; ordinary disciples couldn’t even beg for them.

After Fairy Feng left, several disciples walked over. The one leading them was a woman, and behind her were also three men and two women. One of these men looked older, while the three others appeared to be young disciples of Golden Crow Hall.

“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, I am Jun Yunrue. Honorable Master Fairy Feng already sent me a sound transmission and bid me to look after you.” As Jun Yunrue spoke, she carefully sized up Lin Ming. The four young disciples also looked at Lin Ming with strange eyes filled with judgment, their expressions filled with a thick envy.

Any person that could be personally led by Fairy Feng had to be highly valued in her mind and would likely have incomparably rich resources in the future. It had to be known that although Fairy Feng’s status was inferior to Sage Jiuyang within Phoenix Cry Palace, whether it was in power or influence, obtaining her recognition was only a shot in the dark for the vast majority of disciples. Phoenix Cry Palace was indeed divided into factions, but the majority of disciples didn’t even have the qualifications to enter a faction. They were too weak or their potential was too small. Others didn’t even notice them, so gathering them to their faction was useless to begin with.

“Yes. Senior-apprentice Sister Yunrue, I also look forward to your advice.”

“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is too polite.” Jun Yunrue faintly smiled. She introduced Lin Ming to the other disciples here. “This is Lin Ming. You may call him Junior-apprentice Brother Lin. All of you will have to look after him in the future. Honorable Master Fairy Feng has already sent a sound transmission detailing me on the situation. Junior-apprentice Brother Lin ascended from the lower realms, and he is the top 100,000 year talent of a great world there, able to kill a Divine Sea powerhouse at just the fifth stage of Life Destruction.”

As Jun Yunrue spoke, the other disciples’ eyes widened, especially upon hearing that he was the top 100,000 year talent of a great world and was able to kill Divine Sea powerhouses with a fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation.

Although the martial artists of the lower realms were far inferior to the fierceness of the Divine Realm’s geniuses, it was still a great world with countless trillions of lives. Within such a great number of people, being able to be the top talent in 100,000 years was no trifling matter! Martial artists that ascended were also unrivalled geniuses of their era. They had great potential to begin with, and to them entering the Divine Realm was like a True Dragon plunging into the vast seas, ridding themselves of their shackles and going beyond all control.

The disciples behind Jun Yunrue were valued by Fairy Feng and they were all extremely talented individuals. Each one of them was a proud and haughty genius of their generation and they had all passed fierce competitions and brutal assessments. They were originally common subjects of the Phoenix Cry Palace world, and finally managed to make their way into the ranks of official disciples. Out of the hundreds of millions of lives on this world, they managed to stand out.

Although they were temporarily residing in Golden Crow Hall, it was more or less decided that they would enter Vermillion Bird Hall in the future. They even had high hopes of entering Phoenix Hall. However, they didn’t have the qualifications nor were they as daring to call themselves the top 100,000 year talent of a great world. This title only belonged to a truly freakish monster.

Now that they saw Lin Ming in front of them, besides his handsome appearance and his ethereal, untouchable temperament, he didn’t seem anything special at all. In fact, he was quite ordinary. It was hard to imagine he was such an extreme genius.

A male disciple couldn’t help but curl his lips and say, “The top 100,000 year talent of a great world, this title seems a bit exaggerated, right?”

“I’m not saying I suspect you, it just seems a bit excessive to me. For instance, if I went to the mortal world and saw a random fortune teller who earned his meals by reading palms, and he told me that he was actually a Divine Lord realm powerhouse that wanted to experience life as a common mortal, wouldn’t that be a bit shocking?”

The man shrugged as he spoke. Jun Yunrue’s complexion turned a bit ugly. “What kind of stupid analogy are you trying to make? It’s a complete mess. Well, whatever, first we’ll bring Junior-apprentice Brother to his residence and help him familiarize himself with the area here. Let’s go.”

As these disciples were discussing, Lin Ming didn’t interject once, only lightly smiling throughout. He guessed that Fairy Feng only heard about his matters from the Ancient Phoenix Great Temple’s Temple Spirit, and the Temple Spirit’s knowledge of what happened outside of the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm was extremely limited to begin with. Fairy Feng probably didn’t understand what his true strength was.

As they were walking, the several Golden Crow Hall disciples didn’t give up. They tried to strike up a conversation with Lin Ming, asking, “I must say Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, I heard that you killed many Divine Sea level powerhouses. How many have you slain?”

“Mm, around 15 to 20.” Lin Ming truthfully said. He hadn’t really been paying attention to how many he had killed.

“So, so many?”

The several disciples’ eyes widened. “Good heavens, 15 to 20!”

Although the Divine Sea powerhouses of the lower realms couldn’t be considered powerful, they were still Divine Sea martial artists; killing 15-20 of them was quite an amazing feat.

“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, my name is Lin Junzhi, it seems that we both share the same surname. You are really awesome. Out of those 15-20 Divine Sea powerhouses you killed, who was the most powerful amongst them? What was his cultivation?”

A young female disciple asked while blinking. She looked like a 16-17 year old young girl and was extremely cute and lovable, just like a small rabbit. Her manners were very polite.

Lin Junzhi had to admit that it was impossible for her to kill a Divine Sea powerhouse if she had a fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation. However, the Divine Sea powerhouses of the lower realms were disgustingly weak, and there were even fourth and fifth stage Life Destruction martial artists that were able to rely on lucky chances to enter the Divine Sea. Their strength was pathetic to the point of being an absolute mess, so she did have a faint trace of hope of defeating someone like that.

Lin Ming frankly answered, “The strongest person I killed had an early Divine Sea cultivation.”

The strongest Divine Sea powerhouse Lin Ming was referring to was naturally Yang Yun. Yang Yun had failed to complete his Great Blood Refining Art and had finally relied on combusting his blood essence and ruining his Blood Law Eye in order to forcibly raise his combat strength to the middle Divine Sea for a short period of time. But his cultivation was truly at the early Divine Sea. However, as these disciples heard this, they assumed something different.

“Early Divine Sea realm. That’s not too preposterous.”

Lin Junzhi muttered to herself, patting her chest as if she were letting out a sigh of relief. If it were only the early Divine Sea, the disciples of Golden Crow Hall could also do it. Even their Elder Senior Jun Yunrue could accomplish that.

Another disciple with the surname Lui had an understanding expression as he said to everyone with a true essence sound transmission, “It seems this Lin Ming really did kill a Divine Sea master with a fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation. I heard that the Divine Sea powerhouses of the lower realms are generally absurdly weak, so facing such a Divine Sea powerhouse, it’s possible to kill 15 to 20 of them if he does so one at a time.”

“Mm, I also believe I can do this. Even if I can’t kill them, I can still defeat them.”

“Yeah, and that title of number one talent in 100,000 years might not be so real either; there are many lower realm talents that don’t have this sort of title. But if he has exceptionally rare talent, there might be some people that wanted to win him over so of course they would compliment him and choose some pleasant words like giving him the title of top 100,000 year talent. This title simply spreads around and is repeated to the point that everyone confuses what is real with what is fake.”

“Indeed, Senior-apprentice Brother Liu’s explanation makes much more sense.”

The several disciples spoke amongst each other and quickly found their minds calming down. These talents were all very proud and haughty individuals, they certainly didn’t want to admit that they were weaker than others. Of course, since Lin Ming was personally brought here by Fairy Feng, it was natural he was stronger than them. So long as he was just a tad stronger than them, they could accept it.

As the disciples were talking amongst themselves, Jun Yunrue only listened, not interjecting her opinion. Finally, as they were discussing the ‘final result’, she finally said, “There’s no limit in the universe, there’s always higher heavens and stronger people. Don’t think that the martial artists of the lower realms are all inferior to the martial artists of the Divine Realm. Although the Divine Realm is vast and boundless, the lower realms are just as great. The number of martial artists in the lower realms might even surpass those of the Divine Realm!”

Jun Yunrue glanced at Lin Ming. She could feel that he was restraining his aura within his body. Although she couldn’t speculate anything based on this, she believed in Fairy Feng’s judgment and knew that she wouldn’t be wrong. Lin Ming would inevitably prove that he was an outstanding talent. But as for how strong he actually was, that would be seen in the future.

She suddenly thought of something, saying, “Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, since you just arrived at the Divine Realm you shouldn’t have a good weapon in hand. How about I bring you to Saint Artifact Pavilion to choose one?”

Saint Artifact Pavilion was not a simple weapon storage area. To choose a weapon here depended on one’s strength and talent; it wasn’t as simple as it seemed.

Chapter 954 – Deliberately Creating Difficulties

…

…

…

“Saint Artifact Pavilion! Great, let’s all go!” When Saint Artifact Pavilion was brought up, the other disciples became giddy. Within Saint Artifact Pavilion, there were no treasures besides saint artifacts. Moreover, saint artifacts had massive differences depending on the rank. A peak saint artifact was completely different in value from a general saint artifact. Saint Artifact Pavilion contained not only general saint artifacts but also top ranked high-grade saint artifacts. Of course, whether or not someone could obtain it all relied on their own abilities.

When Lin Ming heard of Saint Artifact Pavilion, he was also tempted. He hadn’t held a weapon he liked in his hand ever since the Purple Comet Spear. Lin Ming had replaced weapons several times, but because of their different natures they didn’t suit him too well.

The first low-grade heaven-step white spear he obtained within the Eternal Demon Abyss had been tossed to him by Duanmu Qun who had bartered for it with a High Lord. It didn’t even have its own name. The quality was rather ordinary and he only casually used it.

As for the second heaven-step, that was a red spear given to him by Timeworn Phoenix City, a common service weapon for being a trial challenger there. Besides that it was exceptionally durable and fire-attributed, it didn’t have any other special characteristics.

The third, the Great Desolate Blood Halberd was a saint artifact rank weapon, but it was still a halberd, not a spear. Moreover, it wasn’t too useful for boosting his Concepts and Laws, and a halberd wasn’t flexible to begin with. This simply wasn’t suited to Lin Ming’s fighting style.

The fourth, the purple spear was a thunder-attribute weapon left behind in the Extreme Violet Ring by Jiang Ziji. He also only occasionally used it.

Now as Lin Ming heard Jun Yunrue mention he could choose a weapon at Saint Artifact Pavilion, his interested was piqued. “Then I must bother Senior-apprentice Sister Jun to guide me.”

Jun Yunrue said, “Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, in Saint Artifact Pavilion, the type of saint artifact you can choose, and whether or not you can at all, will depend on your own ability. If you cannot obtain one, you’ll have wasted this chance. You must remember this and make sure you grasp the chance you are given.”

“Oh?” Lin Ming was startled. He thought that he could choose any weapon from Saint Artifact Pavilion, but now it seemed that there was some other mystery behind it.

Jun Yunrue said, “It isn’t easy for us to exchange enough resources to enter Saint Artifact Pavilion. If you aren’t able to obtain a high-grade saint artifact, even a low-grade saint artifact is a very good result. 95% of the Golden Crow Hall’s disciples don’t have a saint artifact, and even many disciples of the Vermillion Bird Hall haven’t been able to obtain one yet either.”

Even the most ordinary of saint artifacts had a decent value; in the Divine Realm, saint artifacts weren’t as common as cabbage. Within the entire Sky Spill Continent, there were only about ten or so saint artifacts, and even a Divine Kingdom would only have 1 or 2 available to stabilize the destiny of their nation. The Sky Spill Continent’s saint artifacts were all passed down from ancient times 100,000 years ago, and after that, no one had ever been able to forge another one.

Jun Yunrue let the group directly to Saint Artifact Pavilion.

……

Phoenix Cry Palace was built atop a planet, with countless palaces, halls, temples, and other buildings scattered throughout; the area it covered was simply terrifying. In order to pass between different areas of Phoenix Cry Palace, one needed to take transmission arrays or fly for long periods of time.

Lin Ming and the others passed through several transmission arrays on their trip to Saint Artifact Pavilion. Along the way, he saw a massive city with city walls that were over a thousand feet high and spread to the distant horizon. In terms of length and width, this city was several thousand miles. It was equal to a great province in the Sky Fortune Kingdom. There was no city in the Sky Spill Continent that could compare with it.

Such a large city could easily sustain a hundred million people!

However, within the cities of Phoenix Cry Palace, there were substantial amounts of smelting trial areas and related resources. For instance, mountains and jungles where vicious beasts were raised, or grand array formations used for training and testing. Only several million people lived in these cities. They all had a great deal of space, and every family had their own palaces to live in.

Lin Ming passed his perception through these families and discovered that nearly everyone here trained in martial arts. A 12-13 year old child was at the second or third stage of body transformation and at 18-19 years of age they were at the Houtian realm. This meant that the number of talents was also much higher.

The food these people ate was far from what martial artists from the lower realms could compare with. There were all sorts of vicious beast meat, spirit fruits, and spirit vegetables. They would even soak in medicinal baths at a young age, helping their foundation be extremely solid.

Lin Ming couldn’t help but sigh in praise. The martial artists of the Divine Realm would start cultivating at a young age. They took spirit pills and spirit foods from birth, and what they bathed in were medicinal baths. They lived in palaces and what they wore were array clothes. When they went out they would ride on spirit boats and visit others by passing through transmission arrays. If they wanted to train, they could visit any of the training grounds near their homes.

There was also a massive difference in inheritance. Although it wasn’t the top class inheritances of the Divine Realm, it was still far superior to those from the lower realms. In addition, their bloodline talent also vastly exceeded those from the lower realms in quality. This was why they were able to create a martial arts city, a city where everyone practiced martial arts!

With such massive cities developed by a super sect to act as their foundation, how could there not be tremendous amounts of geniuses raised and developed?

Jun Yunrue glanced at Lin Ming and could see the interest playing in his eyes. She smiled and said, “This is a mortal city. There’s several hundred similar cities like this in Phoenix Cry Palace, and every city has several million people. Added together, that is hundreds of millions of people, most of whom are mortals. As for us, we also came from these mortal cities. We showed our skills, rose above the several hundred million people, and finally became disciples of Golden Crow Hall. Let alone Golden Crow Hall, even the lowest Firebird Hall has intense competition to enter. All mortal juniors hope to one day become an official disciple of Phoenix Cry Palace, soaring into the skies with a single leap.”

As Jun Yunrue spoke, Lin Junzhi blushed. She said somewhat embarrassedly, “What are you talking about. I’m still far from being comparable with Senior-apprentice Sister Jun.”

“Haha, Junior-apprentice Sister Lin, your potential is great. Honorable Master Fairy Feng favors you a great deal. Well, let’s end this conversation for now. We’ve finally arrived at Saint Artifact Pavilion.”

Although Jun Yunrue said that, Lin Ming only saw rolling clouds above an endless ea. But above the clouds, there was actually a massive pavilion, floating amongst the clouds as if it were a mirage. On the pavilion there was a giant golden signboard that had three words written in large flowing strokes.

‘Saint Artifact Pavilion’.

“Come, let’s go.”

Jun Yunrue led everyone to the gate of Saint Artifact Pavilion with a sense of familiarity. This was a spacious square paved with fiery red stones as if they were some sort of fire jade. These fire jades were clear and iridescent, shining with a faint red light, seeming as if there was a raging flame simmering within them. These beating flames exuded an incomparably rich fire origin energy, and the massive amount of fire origin energy gathered into the air, forming the faint outline of a dao diagram. Although this was only the elementary form of a postcelestial dao diagram, for them to be formed by just the rich energies here and with no one actively stirring them up, this was proof that the fire origin energy was of a ridiculously high quality!

At this moment, a squad of guards riding fire lions crossed their paths, directly stopping in front of Jun Yunrue and her group. This squad of guards had a Divine Sea cultivation, and the captain was impressively at the late Divine Sea realm.

Lin Ming could feel the energy coming from these guards. Most of them had crossed the seventh stage of Life Destruction, and the captain had likely crossed the eighth stage of Life Destruction. The aura they emitted was formidable.

An eighth stage Life Destruction late Divine Sea cultivation. Lin Ming had to admit that he wasn’t a match.

As the guard captain saw Jun Yunrue, he clamped his legs down on the fire lion’s sides, stopping it and the squad of guards. He cheekily smiled and said, “So it’s Golden Crow Hall’s Junior-apprentice Sister Jun. How come you decided to visit Saint Artifact Pavilion today?”

Jun Yunrue frowned. “I came this time to guide my Junior-apprentice Brother Lin to choose a weapon. I hope that Senior-apprentice Brother Song won’t make things difficult for me.”

“Haha, of course I won’t make things difficult for you. Saint Artifact Pavilion is originally for disciples of Phoenix Cry palace to choose a weapon or magic tool for their own use, why would I think of hindering Junior-apprentice Sister Jun in any way? Well, according to the rules of Saint Artifact Pavilion, those that enter can only choose a single saint artifact, and what they choose will all depend on their own ability. If they can’t obtain one then that is only their own bad luck. Oh, right, those that enter Saint Artifact Pavilion must pay 3000 phoenix cry seal marks or an equal value in violet sun stones.” The guard captain licked his lips as he looked at Jun Yunrue and Lin Ming with greedy eyes.

“What? 3000 phoenix cry marks!? Entering Saint Artifact Pavilion only costs 1000 phoenix cry seal marks! Why are you charging us three times the price?”

The so-called phoenix cry seal marks was a point system for the disciples of Phoenix Cry Palace based on the merits they performed. For instance when killing enemies in sect wars, finding heavenly materials, and handing in cultivation jade slips of other sects, these and other tasks, one could receive phoenix cry seal marks according to their contribution. There were even some people on the level of Sage Jiuyang who could create their own martial skills and pass those to the sect as inheritances and receive a corresponding amount of phoenix cry seal marks.

The phoenix cry seal mark was a form of currency used solely in Phoenix Cry Palace. It could be used to purchase a number of sect benefits. Entering Saint Artifact Pavilion was one such sect benefit.

“Oh? Is that so? Too bad, it seems prices have risen recently.” The guard captain smiled, clearly containing a mocking meaning behind it.

Jun Yunrue’s complexion turned overcast. The rules of Saint Artifact Pavilion hadn’t changed for 10,000 years. If there was such a great change it would be spread throughout the entire palace, but there had been no news at all. It was clear that this guard captain was deliberately creating roadblocks for them, but there was nothing she could do about it. She only had an early Divine Sea cultivation; she wasn’t a match for this guard captain. As the Elder Senior Sister who managed Fairy Feng’s faction at Golden Crow Hall, she led her juniors-apprentice brothers and sisters here to choose a weapon. But they hadn’t even passed the gate and yet there were difficulties blocking their way. How could she possibly raise her head in this circumstance?

“Song Baifeng, I’ll remember this!” Jun Yunrue grit her teeth and traced her spatial ring, preparing to pay the 3000 phoenix cry seal marks for each disciple. It was best to let Lin Ming choose a weapon before doing anything else.

At this time, Lin Ming’s true essence sound transmission echoed in her ears. “Senior-apprentice Sister, what’s going on here? They’re only the guards of Saint Artifact Pavilion and yet they can arbitrarily extort you like this? Is there no one that can manage them?”

As Lin Ming saw Jun Yunrue about to capitulate, he couldn’t help but ask her this. This was simply too outrageous. In such a massive place like Phoenix Cry Palace, how could a late Divine Sea realm guard be so arrogant?

Jun Yunrue shook her head, “They are Sage Jiuyang’s people. Not only are the guards of Saint Artifact Pavilion his people, but also the guards of the Pill Pavilion and the Scripture Pavilion, all of them are disciples subordinate to Sage Jiuyang. Within the entire Phoenix Cry Palace, besides the Palace Elders and the Phoenix Cry palace master, Sage Jiuyang can be called omnipotent. Do you really expect to count on the Palace Elders and the Phoenix Cry Palace Master to worry about minor matters like this? So these people under Sage Jiuyang can randomly make rules up to hinder us because we are Honorable Master Fairy Feng’s people and there is nothing we can do about it. Do you think we can go complain to Sage Jiuyang or something?”

“These guards know this so they are deliberately creating troubles for us to line their own pockets. Of course, Sage Jiuyang is also happy to see these situations occur.”

Chapter 955 – Huang Yuehong

…

…

…

Sage Jiuyang’s people were lurking everywhere within Phoenix Cry Palace. This meant that all those who dared to be hostile against him would be pushed aside!

If Fairy Feng herself were here today, then Song Baifeng wouldn’t even dare to say a single rude word. Otherwise, that would be offending a Vice Palace Master and Fairy Feng would have the authority to punish him on the spot.

However, Jun Yunrue and her group had no choice but to swallow this insult. In the end, she was just too weak. Her cultivation was only at the early Divine Sea. Even if her talent far surpassed this Song Baifeng in front of her, she still wasn’t his match at this moment.

As for the disciples behind Jun Yunrue, they were only at the seventh and eighth stage of Life Destruction or at the half-step Divine Sea; they weren’t any better. They would be instantly defeated by Song Baifeng.

Lin Ming wasn’t any better either. His cultivation was only at the fifth stage of Life Destruction while Song Baifeng was an eighth stage Life Destruction late Divine Sea realm martial artist, far superior to the early Divine Sea Yang Yun.

The weak could only allow themselves to be suppressed everywhere.

“Song Baifeng, I will remember this.” Jun Yunrue took out a jade book from her spatial ring. After opening the book, one could see pages covered with rows upon rows of dense red seal marks, as if they were phalanxes of tadpoles. These were phoenix cry seal marks, a type of contribution point that Phoenix Cry Palace recorded for their disciples. Every contribution point was a single phoenix cry seal mark, and they could be transferred or traded to others. Because many resources at Phoenix Cry Palace required phoenix cry seal marks to purchase or access, they were much more welcomed by the disciples than violet sun stones, a type of currency that was always in demand.

Jun Yunrue waved her hand and several thousand red seal marks left the jade book. At this moment, a rich and compelling voice suddenly sounded out. “Isn’t that Junior-apprentice Sister Jun Yunrue?”

Everyone turned to see a spirit boat flying towards them. This spirit boat was carved from priceless jade and it was being towed by nine golden crows. At the bow of this spirit boat, an elegant youth in embroidered robes slowly flew down, accompanied by two others behind him, both of which had a late Divine Sea cultivation.

The elegant youth held a folding fan, his feet stepping atop an auspicious cloud. Motes of light faintly floated around him as if he were an immortal exiled from heaven.

This youth’s cultivation was deep like the sea, and his appearance was extraordinarily handsome. He emitted a kingly atmosphere from head to toe, making one feel awed in his presence.

If this person were described within the world of mortals, then he would be a naturally born emperor. Whether it was his temperament, aura, or appearance, everything he possessed was so.

“Huang Yuegong, Senior-apprentice Brother Huang!”

As Song Baifeng and the other guards of Saint Artifact Pavilion saw this elegant youth, they were surprised for a brief moment before revealing flattering smiles. They hurriedly jumped off their fire lions to greet him.

To dismount when greeting someone was an expression of respect, otherwise it would give off a commanding and superior feeling. When Song Baifeng faced Jun Yunrue and the others, he didn’t step off his mount. But now he rapidly dismounted. It was clear that this person had a noble status.

“Who is that?” Lin Ming couldn’t help but ask with a true essence sound transmission. Although he could feel that this elegant youth had an early Divine Sea cultivation, he could feel that his aura was vastly different from others. In other words, he was an extremely terrifying individual.

Jun Yunrue took a deep breath and said, “That is Phoenix Hall disciple Huang Yuegong. He has a ninth stage Life Destruction Divine Sea cultivation! Don’t look at him being at just the early Divine Sea realm. In true battle, his strength even surpasses Song Baifeng. His foundation is absolutely solid, and in the future he even has great hopes of becoming a character on the level of a Divine Lord! Moreover, after reaching the Divine Lord realm, the inner world he creates will be far larger than others. It might hold mountains, rivers, seas, and even stars.”

“Oh? Phoenix Hall? Ninth stage of Life Destruction!”

Lin Ming’s thoughts stirred. Phoenix Hall was the highest rank of disciple, equal to a core disciple.

He deeply gazed at Huang Yuegong. Besides Fairy Feng and a few others, this was the first time he truly saw a ninth stage Life Destruction powerhouse. A ninth stage Life Destruction powerhouse was indeed far more horrifying than an eighth stage Life Destruction martial artist!

Jun Yunrue continued, “Not only is Huang Yuegong strong, but his background is the Huang Family Clan. The Huang Family Clan is one of the three great family clans of our Ancient Phoenix Clan, along with the Huo Family Clan and the Xiao Family Clan! Within Phoenix Cry Palace, the ones that cannot be provoked are these types of individuals, those that are extremely strong and also come from prominent noble families. That is the reason why Song Baifeng flatters him like this.”

“I see…” Lin Ming said, suddenly aware. This sort of person was strong and their roots were deep. Offending them would often lead to a miserable outcome. Only they were allowed to step on others; no one would dare move against them.

“Could he also be in Sage Jiuyang’s faction?”

Jun Yunrue said, “The Huo, Xiao, and Huang Family Clans intensely compete amongst each other, but in the Ancient Phoenix Clan, they’re all connected through various divisions of benefits. They’ll certainly support the juniors of the three great family clans over others. In Phoenix Cry Palace, the Huang Family Clan supports the Xiao Family Clan, and in some other palaces, the Xiao Family Clan will support the Huang Family Clan. This Huang Yuegong is also one of Sage Jiuyang’s people. He hasn’t grown too strong now, but in the future once he reaches Divine Transformation or even the Divine Lord realm, he will definitely become a big boost to Sage Jiuyang’s position!”

Lin Ming understood the approximate situation about Huang Yuegong at Phoenix Cry Palace. Although he was only a junior for now, he would inevitably shine in the future, blooming into brilliance.

Huang Yuegong didn’t land on the floor, instead staying floating in the air. As he watched Jun Yunrue and the others, his expression and eyes were just like a king overlooking his subjects. The other disciples behind Lin Ming drew back several steps. Against such a character they lacked the energy to withstand the tremendous pressure.

In the end, they came from humble origins and were ordinary themselves. In the face of someone from the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s noble Huang Family Clan, they naturally felt awe and fear.

“Someone that ascended from the lower realms.” Huang Yuegong instantly discovered Lin Ming and his eyes swept through him. Lin Ming felt a perception rush through his body like a vast and surging tide, as if all his secrets were being flipped over.

However, this feeling left just as fast as it came, lasting only for the briefest of moments. After, Huang Yuegong ignored Lin Ming as if he hadn’t seen him at all, instead treating Jun Yunrue and the two other female disciples to a bright smile.

“Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, how are you? Are you here to find a saint artifact? If Junior-apprentice Sister Jun needs a saint artifact, in truth you only needed to speak to me. Here, I just happen to have a good saint artifact here that is for women to use. It would be better served in the hands of Junior-apprentice Sister Jun.”

Huang Yuegong flicked his hand and a bracelet flew toward Jun Yunrue. This bracelet seemed as if it was forged from starlight. In an instant, it wrapped around her hand without leaving her the chance to react. This also reflected the vast disparity of strength between Huang Yuegong and Jun Yunrue.”

As the twinkling silver bracelet was worn on Jun Yunrue’s white arms, it was especially beautiful.

“This is, a low-grade saint artifact?” Jun Yunrue’s eyebrows shot up. As she looked at her hand, an incredulous expression was etched on her face. She wanted to decline it but she hesitated instead.

“Yes. That is a low-grade saint artifact called the Chain of Stars. If you wear it, it has the effect of nourishing your soul. Moreover, when you revolve your true essence it will enhance your strength by 10%.” Huang Yuegong said with a smiling face.

A saint artifact was very precious and many disciples of Vermillion Bird Hall didn’t even have one. An accessory type saint artifact was several times more valuable than other types of saint artifacts. A low-grade saint artifact bracelet far surpassed an ordinary medium-grade offensive saint artifact in value.

For instance, Lin Ming’s saint artifact bracer was able to increase his perception. It played an extremely helpful supporting role when he was comprehending Laws. This was one of the more prized treasures he had obtained from the Temple of Marvels.

The bracelet Huang Yuegong just casually gifted wasn’t much worse than Lin Ming’s saint artifact bracer. It was extremely difficult for Jun Yunrue to decline this gift; she really liked this bracer. Moreover, the use of this bracer was amazing. With it, Jun Yunrue’s strength would increase and she could rise even quicker and enter Phoenix Hall, becoming a core disciple.

Huang Yuegong chuckled, “Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, this bracelet looks beautiful on you, as if it were custom made for your wrists.”

Jun Yunrue’s appearance was exceptional. Her chest was full and seductive and her legs were straight and slender. Her butt and thighs curved up deliciously, and her expression was usually stern. Due to her beauty, this sternness actually contained a beguiling charm. Because of this, Jun Yunrue was also exceedingly appealing even in the Ancient Phoenix Clan where beauties were present like clouds. She attracted the attention and pursuit of many men.

Moreover, Jun Yunrue was favored by Fairy Feng and her talent was good. Although she was currently in the Golden Crow Hall, in truth she could enter the Vermillion Bird Hall whenever she pleased. It wouldn’t even be a problem for her to enter the Phoenix Hall in the future. Her prospects were bright and shining.

The action of Huang Yuegong sending out this bracelet was obvious in its meaning. Behind Jun Yunrue, Lin Junzhi and the other female disciple looked on with expressions full of envy.

As Huang Yuegong saw the two young women’s responses, he faintly smiled and said, “Although this is my first time meeting these two fellow junior-apprentice sisters, our meeting can also be considered a stroke of fate. Here are two low-grade saint artifact swords; consider them a meeting gift.”

Huang Yuegong waved his hands and two saint artifact swords shot out. These two swords sparkled with a bright light, sharp and cold. One could see they were excellent swords at first glance!

As Lin Ming saw these two swords, he couldn’t help but sigh at just how shamefully and excessively wealthy Huang Yuegong was. Out of all the swords he had seen throughout his life, besides the Argent White Sword surpassing these two swords in quality, all other swords were like scrap metal in comparison.

“This, this…”

As Lin Junzhi received this sword, her cute face blushed red. She never thought that Huang Yuegong would gift such a precious gift on their first meeting. She came from a humble mortal background, so where could she ever obtain a saint artifact? And now someone actually gifted her this divine sword, how could she not be amazed.

Behind Lin Junzhi, the other male disciples had expressions thick with envy. They licked their lips and looked at Huang Yuegong, hoping that he would also gift them something.

As Lin Ming saw their eyes, he shook his head.

As for Huang Yuegong, his eyes flashed with a trace of disdain. He folded his hands together, holding no meaning of giving them anything.

Behind Huang Yuegong, one of his two subordinates laughed heartily, “These two idiots, who do they think they are? Young Master gave the sister apprentices saint artifacts because he favors them. Especially that Jun Yunrue, she is truly a top quality woman. Those two ridiculous fools, they have the face of a slave, have they ever even looked in a mirror? It’s like they really think they’re in high demand or something.”

The other subordinate said, “This also can’t be helped. Yan Fengxian came from a common origin, so the disciples she gathers are mostly from the same common origin. To the poor, an ordinary saint artifact can have their eyes go red with jealousy!”

Chapter 956 – The Rules for Obtaining a Saint Artifact

…

…

…

The two lackeys talked with each other using true essence sound transmissions. They sized up the two male disciples, looking at them the same way a noble looked at a beggar.

Huang Yuegong maintained a smiling expression; the deep loathing and contempt he felt was hidden deep within his eyes. As for the two male disciples, they didn’t notice anything at all. They didn’t realize that the only reason Huang Yuegong was showing such grace was due to the presence of Jun Yunrue, otherwise he would have told them to screw off.

Huang Yuegong was rich but it wasn’t like saint artifacts fell from the sky. There were still many beauties he could give saint artifacts, so how could he waste them on these two ugly pieces of trash?

“I must say young master, I think that this little Jun girl is tempted by you. Haha, and who can blame her? Young master is so handsome and dashing, and he even gifted such a valuable gift on their first meeting, which girl wouldn’t have her heart moved by this? It’s a surprise she isn’t already obediently crawling into young master’s bed!”

“Hehe, this Jun Yunrue’s talent isn’t bad. If young master can suck up her primal yin energy, it’ll be beneficial to young master’s cultivation method. Moreover, her figure is so soft and ample, I’m sure she tastes great. If the two other female disciples are added on top, then it’ll be that much better!”

The two lackeys’ words were filled with crudely suggestive innuendos. Huang Yuegong maintained his composure and said, “I don’t value this Jun Yunrue just because I desire her and want to conquer her. The key factor is that I value her potential. She has an over 70% chance of stepping into Phoenix Hall and becoming a core disciple in the future. Once her cultivation is higher, she can even be a useful helper to my cause. I have a complete understanding into the behavior of women like her. Once I conquer her body and mind, she will follow me with her entire heart. Moreover, she is also one of Fairy Feng’s people. If I conceal my relationship with her and leave her as a spy with Fairy Feng, that would be even better.”

Huang Yuegong swung his fan, his expression brimming with confidence. He had a tremendous amount of experience in chasing after women. These past years, he succeeded in obtaining the hearts of countless women, moreover, they weren’t common women either. They were all outstanding geniuses that were proud daughters of heaven.

“Amazing! Young master’s methods are so amazing!” The two lackeys endlessly flattered Huang Yuegong, spewing out all sorts of praises. It was obvious they were skilled in flattery.

“I thought that young master only wanted to satisfy the desires of the flesh, but I never imagined young master would plan so far into the future. This is really hitting two birds with one stone. Not only can young master enjoy this girl, but she will also be a servant to young master! Fierce, way too fierce!”

Huang Yuegong’s exchange with his lackeys only took an instant; Jun Yunrue obviously didn’t know of it. She bit her lips and reluctantly looked at the beautiful and useful bracelet on her wrist. She took it off, and said, “Senior-apprentice Brother Huang, this gift is just too precious for us. I cannot receive it.”

Although the bracelet was good, Jun Yunrue wasn’t an idiot. To hand her such a gift on a simple meeting, it was clear that Huang Yuegong was pursuing her.

Receiving this gift would be equal to tacitly consenting to the pursuit of Huang Yuegong. If that happened, sooner or later she would be conquered by him. The key problem was that Huang Yuegong was Sage Jiuyang’s person while she was Fairy Feng’s person. How could the two of them ever have a future together?

Even though Jun Yunrue dearly desired this bracelet, she had no choice but to return it.

As Jun Yunrue returned the bracelet, Lin Junzhi and the other female disciple also hesitantly returned their swords. They were well aware of the twisting circumstances to them receiving these gifts; it was clear that Huang Yuegong targeted Jun Yunrue. Since Jun Yunrue returned her gift, it would be shameful if they kept theirs.

“Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, this is only a minor gift. It means nothing to me, so please don’t decline it.”

“I really cannot receive this. I can only turn down Senior-apprentice Brother Huang’s good intentions.”

Huang Yuegong faintly smiled as he saw Jun Yunrue firmly turn down his gift. He said, “That’s fine. It seems I was too brash in presenting this gift and offended a beauty. It doesn’t matter if Junior-apprentice Sister Jun refuses this gift. After we finish our treasure hunt at Saint Artifact Pavilion, how about we share a meal and talk further?”

Huang Yuegong knew when to stop. It was clear that Jun Yunrue was tempted this time. As long as she was tempted, there was hope. If he could launch another offensive in the future and do something that she liked, this beauty would be his sooner or later.

Only this sort of difficult women that cost him time and effort would raise his ardor. Just waving a hand and having a girl join his bed was meaningless.

“That is, I still have some matters to manage later. I’m afraid I cannot agree to Senior-apprentice Brother Huang.” Jun Yunrue’s expression and tone already softened. Although she and Huang Yuegong belonged to different factions, in the face of a gentleman who was so strong and came from such a prominent family and even treated her so kindly, it was impossible to say that she didn’t have a favorable impression of him.

“It doesn’t matter, we’ll always have more chances in the future. That’s right, Junior-apprentice Sister Jun was planning to enter Saint Artifact Pavilion? How many of you are entering?” Huang Yuegong didn’t continue bothering her about the matter, instead switching topics.

“Three people. Me, Junior-apprentice Sister Lin, and also Junior-apprentice Brother Lin who just joined.” Jun Yunrue indicated Lin Ming. From the beginning until now, Lin Ming remained unknown in the background. With his cultivation and background, it was easy for others to assume he was an attendant of some sort. In Huang Yuegong’s eyes, this sort of attendant was no different from an ant. He didn’t’ even bother sparing him a glance.

“Oh? Three people? But when I was on my spirit boat I seemed to see Junior-apprentice Sister Jun pull out more than 3000 phoenix cry seal marks. It looked as if there were 9000 of them?

Huang Yuegong’s eyesight was extraordinary; he could see the exact number of phoenix cry seal marks that Jun Yunrue had taken out. Song Baifeng panicked as he heard this. He quickly said, “Sir Huang, this servant should die, this servant was confused for a moment so…”

Song Baifeng was extremely tense. Being a guard for Saint Artifact Pavilion was a highly sought after role with many advantages. For him to reach this point with his common civilian disciple status, that was because he was able to predict the moods and mood changes of others; he knew who he could offend and who he had to flatter. As for someone like Huang Yuegong who had such a deep background, he could order any of them wherever he wished, even if it were to guard a tomb. The difference between them was simply like the heavens and earth.

How could he not be panicking?

The truth was that Huang Yuegong already understood the situation when he asked this question; he was only deliberately questioning the guard captain to show off his power. He frowned, pretending to be angry, “Song Baifeng, you are just a guard of Saint Artifact Pavilion and yet you dare to extort Junior-apprentice Sister Jun?”

“Sir Huang please forgive me, I will never dare to do something like this again. This servant has eyes but couldn’t see Mount Tai. This servant never knew that Junior-apprentice Sister Jun was good friends with Sir Huang. Had I known this earlier, I would’ve allowed her to freely enter Saint Artifact Pavilion.

Song Baifeng’s words were carefully chosen. Huang Yuegong was pleasantly delighted to hear them. He wished that he could clap Song Baifeng’s shoulder and say ‘good job!’.

“Humph, there better not be a next time. As a guard of Saint Artifact Pavilion, you should follow regulations in handling all matters. One thousand phoenix cry seal marks for one person, I will pay!”

Huang Yuegong raised his hands and took out 4000 phoenix cry seal marks. Jun Yunrue wanted to stop him but bit her lips, not saying anything.

As for Song Baifeng, he shook his head like a rattle, not willing to receive them. He wanted Huang Yuegong and the others to quickly enter free of charge.

This performance satisfied Huang Yuegong. Song Baifeng was indeed a smart man; he had shown him enough face. He said to one of his lackeys with a true essence sound transmission, “Give this Song Baifeng 15,000 phoenix cry seal marks later to make up for his losses today, otherwise this will be considered free entry. In truth, he would have to take out these phoenix cry seal marks from his own purse later. Although this minor character isn’t worth mentioning, he still shouldn’t suffer a loss since we must win him over.”

Huang Yuegong was utterly thorough in all matters, like a watertight basket. The lackey responded, “Young master has really considered all angles. Truly fierce. This servant will manage it later.”

Huang Yuegong smiled, “Since that’s the case, I won’t be humble. Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, let’s go.”

Huang Yuegong gestured invitingly. Jun Yunrue blushed. She waved at Lin Ming and the others, “Let’s go. Thank you Senior-apprentice Brother Huang.”

Song Baifeng led the way with a bright and shining smile. His attitude towards Jun Yunrue took a complete 180 degree turn, and all of this was because of Huang Yuegong.

“Senior-apprentice Brother Huang is really gallant.”

The disciples behind Jun Yunrue began speaking to each other with true essence sound transmissions. The female disciples had cheeks tinged pink.

“That’s right. Look at that Song Baifeng, he was like a dog seeing his master.”

“He’s handsome, strong, and even so generous. Where would you find such great husband material? How could Senior-apprentice Sister Jun reject him? Perhaps Senior-apprentice Sister Jun can even go with him and pull him over to our side.”

The two female disciples kept recalling the swords that Huang Yuegong gifted them, feeling it was a pity they had to return them. As Lin Ming was in their group, he also heard the true essence sound transmissions being exchanged. He could only secretly shake his head. The idea of winning over someone like Huang Yuegong was simply too na?ve.

As the disciples were in discussion, they entered Saint Artifact Pavilion.

Song Baifeng fastidiously introduced, “For obtaining the treasures of Saint Artifact Pavilion, everyone should be well informed. But there’s some new junior-apprentice brothers and sisters that might not know, so I will blabber on for a bit.”

“Saint Artifact Pavilion is in itself a great magic tool with its own intelligence. In order to obtain a treasure, one must first obtain the approval of Saint Artifact Pavilion.”

“As for the factors that Saint Artifacts Pavilion considers, there are many. For instance, destiny, bloodline, perception, comprehension of Laws, and even your own moral character might be one. But those are only secondary. The truth is that the two most important aspects that Saint Artifact Pavilion considers are talent and potential!”

A martial artist’s talent was similar to their potential, but there were some slight differences.

Talent was a martial artist’s true comprehensive combat strength in comparison to their age. At the same age, those that were stronger had the greater talent. At the same strength, those that were younger had the greater talent.

But potential measures the future growth of a martial artist. A high talent didn’t necessarily mean a great potential. There were many eighth stage Life Destruction Divine Sea powerhouses that for all sorts of various reasons could surpass a ninth stage Life Destruction Divine Sea powerhouse in strength. But in terms of potential, they would be surpassed at some point.

In order to obtain a treasure in Saint Artifact Pavilion, one had to first earn the recognition of Saint Artifact Pavilion. As for the rank of the treasure, that would depend on how great one’s potential and talent were. While one only had to pay a thousand phoenix cry seal marks, which were hundreds of times less expensive than a true saint artifact in value, the truth was that most disciples that entered Saint Artifact Pavilion left empty-handed.

Chapter 957 – Phoenix Blood Spear

…

…

…

After Song Baifeng finished his introduction he pushed open the doors to Saint Artifact Pavilion. At the same time, a compelling slaughter energy surged outward, making all in its presence tremble. The several disciples beside Jun Yunrue felt as if they were turned into little babies with cold and sharp swords pointed between their eyebrows. A cold energy seeped into their bones, a killing intent overflowing into the world!

They couldn’t help but draw back one step. Song Baifeng proudly said, “The saint artifacts in Saint Artifact Pavilion have histories of tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years. Some have followed proud sons of heavens, and some have been handed down by Palace Elders. These saint artifacts have been quenched in the blood of countless battles and have been used to tear down numerous extreme powerhouses. The killing intent they emanate is terrifying.”

Saint Artifact Pavilion was established several hundred thousands of years ago. Every year there were new saint artifacts brought in as well as saint artifacts taken out by disciples. Most of the saint artifacts here were low-grade saint artifacts, thousands of them. Beyond that, there were fewer medium-grade saint artifacts, even fewer high-grade saint artifacts, and finally only a small number of top grade saint artifacts. Amongst these top grade saint artifacts, there were some that approached a transcendent saint artifact, in other words, a spirit artifact!

Saint artifacts were divided into four grades; low-grade, medium-grade, high-grade, and top grade. It wasn’t like common treasures that were divided into human-step, earth-step, and heaven-step, with many grades within.

Above a top grade saint artifact was a transcendent saint artifact. Some transcendent saint artifacts would gain their own spiritual sense. Once they gained life, they would also gain wisdom. The with transcendent saint artifacts with wisdom were called spirit artifacts.

A spirit artifact could even cultivate to raise its own boundary. Theoretically speaking, once a treasure reached the rank of a spirit artifact, it would have unlimited potential for growth and be able to rise without limit. This process was extremely difficult, far more so than a martial artist cultivating.

A person that could have a transcendent saint artifact or spirit artifact was a Supreme Elder that controlled their own territory, a true top character!

If a transcendent saint artifact was given to a martial artist at the Divine Sea realm, Divine Transformation realm, or even those at the weaker end of the Divine Lord realm, it would be difficult for them to draw out its full potential. They would only be able to display less than 10% of the artifact’s power.

There were no transcendent saint artifacts placed within Saint Artifact Pavilion, but even an ordinary high-grade saint artifact was extremely heaven-defying. It would be able to greatly enhance a martial artist’s strength. It was far from what a mere treasure tool would be able to accomplish.

In the end, a treasure was merely a weapon that didn’t contain any strength itself. It relied on a martial artist pouring their true essence into it in order to become sharper and firmer, gaining the advantage in collisions with other weapons.

But a saint artifact was different. A saint artifact contained an inherent strength. From a common treasure to a saint artifact, that was the difference between a mortal and an immortal.

Huang Yuegong was disgustingly wealthy, but the most he could gift were low-grade and medium-grade saint artifacts.

As for high-grade saint artifacts, he wasn’t able to gift those, because he used high-grade saint artifacts himself. Moreover, he only had three.

Amongst saint artifacts, every different grade was dozens or even hundreds of times more valuable than a lower grade. As for a top grade saint artifact, not even Huang Yuegong had one. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that if Jun Yunrue managed to obtain a top grade saint artifact and also obtained the recognition of that saint artifact, she could immediately challenge Song Baifeng and even defeat him.

If Lin Ming obtained a top grade saint artifact, he would be able to instantly kill Yang Yun. Even if Yang Yun completed the Great Blood Refining Art and reached the middle Divine Sea, he would die all the same!

This was because a saint artifact in itself contained an immense power!

……

The interior of Saint Artifact Pavilion wasn’t a hall but an incomparably broad and vast world. As everyone entered they fell onto an endless plain. Floating above them were stars. Each star had the faint shadow of a saint artifact within it.

There were large and small stars, and the light they released also varied between strong and weak.

Song Baifeng said, “The brighter a saint artifact, the higher its grade and the more powerful it is. Each of you only has a single chance. Do what you wish. If you cannot pass the trial of Saint Artifact Pavilion, it means you will fail in obtaining anything here, and you will have wasted your chance. You may start whenever you please.”

“Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, please.” Huang Yuegong smiled as he spoke. He had a very explicit goal in entering Saint Artifact Pavilion this time and that was to obtain one of the several top grade saint artifacts. Although a high-grade saint artifact was valuable, he already had three of them. Phoenix Cry Palace had a rule; that was that a Phoenix Hall disciple could obtain at most two saint artifacts from Saint Artifact Pavilion no matter what grade it was. Other halls could only obtain one.

With this limit, Huang Yuegong definitely wanted to obtain a top grade saint artifact.

“Junior-apprentice Sister Lin, would you like to try first?” Jun Yunrue looked at Lin Junzhi.

“I…” Lin Junzhi looked at the stars floating above her, somewhat nervous. She was afraid she would waste this chance. Every attempt cost 1000 phoenix cry seal marks. To a humble disciple with common origins like her, this was an immense amount of wealth.

“Junior-apprentice Sister Lin, there is no need to be anxious. Just do what you can. Choose a low-grade saint artifact. With Junior-apprentice Sister Lin’s talent, there shouldn’t be any problems.” Huang Yuegong softly said, a smile brightening his complexion like the gentle warm rays of a morning sun. His smile contained a strange charm and inexplicably calmed Lin Junzhi down.

Lin Junzhi gratefully looked at Huang Yuegong and forcefully nodded.

She opened her already excessively large eyes even wider and looked at the numerous stars in the sky. Finally, it seemed as if she had decided something with a great deal of determination. She flew toward one of the modestly glowing stars.

What this star contained was a low grade saint artifact vestment.

A vestment type of saint artifact was naturally several times more valuable than a weapon type saint artifact. But it was correspondingly much more difficult to obtain.

Hu- !

With a light sound, Lin Junzhi was sucked into that shining starlight.

Now she had to face the test of Saint Artifact Pavilion.

Lin Ming wasn’t completely sure just what this test entailed, but he could see that the star blazed even brighter and the space around it seemed to twist around.

“Good, she’s managed to last for an incense stick of time. Junior-apprentice Sister Lin has hopes of succeeding.”

Huang Yuegong smiled as he spoke. Every saint artifact was sealed within an illusionary space. If one was ejected early then that was basically defeat. Of course, there was also a chance that one could immediately pass through the test. However, what kind of idiot would choose a saint artifact they could obtain so easily instead of a higher ranked saint artifact?

Besides Lin Ming, the other disciples were secretly fretting over Lin Junzhi. They had no idea whether or not she would succeed.

One incense stick of time passed, two incense sticks of time, a quarter hour…

Time slowly passed. At this moment, the star suddenly flared out and Lin Junzhi was shot out. Her complexion was flushed red and she was panting for breath. She had clearly consumed a great deal of energy.

After Lin Junzhi was sent out, the star in the sky twinkled several more times and then a vestment slowly fell downwards. As this happened, the star gradually lost its light, dimming down until it disappeared.

Lin Junzhi grasped this lightly fluttering piece of clothing with a face filled with excitement. This piece of clothing was extremely bright and colorful, as if it had been made from the feathers of a peacock. There was also a faint halo that surrounded it. This halo was an extremely durable protection. It could merge into one’s true essence. If someone wanted to harm Lin Junzhi, they would first have to break the protection of this saint artifact vestment.

“Congratulations Junior-apprentice Sister Lin, you have obtained this vestment and the quality is also extremely high. Compared to a weapon type saint artifact, it’s much more precious.

Huang Yuegong chuckled. Beside him, Song Baifeng also congratulated her. Lin Junzhi felt a bit embarrassed by all the praise.

She clutched this attractive piece of clothing to her chest. What kind of girl didn’t love beauty? This vestment wasn’t just beautiful but it was also highly useful. To Lin Junzhi, it was the perfect gift.

“Junior-apprentice Sister Lin, you’ve done well.” Jun Yunrue said.

It was already excellent for someone new that entered Saint Artifact Pavilion to return with something in their hands. Lin Junzhi was also someone that was favored by Fairy Feng. Her obtaining this vestment proved that Fairy Feng’s judgment was correct.

“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, would you like to try taking one?”

Jun Yunrue glanced at Lin Ming. Lin Ming shook his head, “Senior-apprentice Sister, I haven’t chosen one yet. I’d like to look around some more.”

Lin Ming could see that at the area near the entrance of Saint Artifact Pavilion, the saint artifacts were all low-grade. When Lin Ming was at the Sky Spill Continent, he obtained five different saint artifacts; the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace, the Extremely Violet Ring, the Extreme Violet Bracer, as well as the complete Demon Emperor Armor. There was also the quasi-saint artifact Cosmic Melting Furnace.

Afterwards, Lin Ming gave the Demon Emperor Armor and the Coiling Martial Divine Furnace to Mu Qianyu so that she could use it to stabilize the destiny of Divine Phoenix Island as well as to protect herself. The rest was brought up to the Divine Realm on his body. Since he already had the low-grade saint artifact Great Desolate Blood Halberd, there was no point in swapping it out for another low-grade saint artifact spear.

“That’s also a good decision. Choosing a saint artifact is a great event. Take your time and look around, I will choose my own in the meantime.”

Jun Yunrue walked deep into Saint Artifact Pavilion.

The depths of Saint Artifact Pavilion were much deeper than the area near the entrance. Here, the stars in the sky were far larger and much brighter. Many stars were dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times brighter than those at the entrance!

In particular, the nine largest stars shined with a bright heavenly light, as if they were scorching suns!

The boundless atmosphere that surged from them left shock in Lin Ming’s heart, leaving him dumbfounded.

Huang Yuegong’s eyes revealed a trace of contempt as he saw Lin Ming’s shocked expression.

A lower realms martial artist that ascended to the Divine Realm was similar to a country bumpkin entering into a great city. How would they ever have had the chance to experience the majesty of a top grade saint artifact?

As Huang Yuegong thought this, he proudly said, “Those nine stars that shine like suns are top grade saint artifacts. There are nine in total. In my Ancient Phoenix Clan, nine is our most precious and divine number which is why there’s always nine top grade saint artifacts at Saint Artifact Pavilion. These nine saint artifacts are the nine suns that shine in the sky!”

“Among these nine top grade saint artifacts, there is a sword, a saber, a spear, a bow, a pill furnace, a vestment, a ring, a necklace, and an armor!”

“For instance, the Sunpierce Sword is forged by a late Divine Transformation master using a Solar Flame Essence as foundation. He placed it in his own inner world to temper it for an incalculable period of time, integrating countless heavenly materials to repeatedly refine it until completion. It is incomparably sharp!”

“Then there is the spear, the Phoenix Blood Spear. When that spear was forged, it was quenched not in water but in phoenix blood! How precious is phoenix blood? A martial artist normally only needs several dozen drops to soar into the heavens. If an ordinary bird were to obtain just a tiny bit of phoenix blood, it could transform into a golden crow or a vermillion bird! And that precious phoenix blood was actually used to quench this saint artifact. This Blood Phoenix Spear contains the essence of phoenix blood. It’s impossible to guess just how strong it is!”

As Huang Yuegong spoke, his eyes shined with a heated passionate light. The reason he entered Saint Artifact Pavilion this time was for these nine top grade saint artifacts!

“Phoenix Blood Spear…” Lin Ming’s eyes shone as he heard these words. As his vision fell onto the star of that spear, he couldn’t move them away anymore.

Chapter 958 – Obtaining Treasures

…

…

…

Lin Ming looked as far as he could. He was able to vaguely make out a crimson long spear within the center of the blazing sun. Countless runes shined on its body and a vast and boundless atmosphere surged out from it.

Even though the nine suns hanging in the skies were the brightest of the many stars, they all had minor differences between then; some had a weaker light and others had a stronger light. The light of the Phoenix Blood Spear was one of the brightest; it was one of the most brilliant saint treasures. This proved that even though the Phoenix Blood Spear was a top grade treasure, it was still positioned at the top of its rank!

Besides the Phoenix Blood Spear, the Sunpierce Sword’s light wasn’t any dimmer. The sword was clearly a top saint artifact amongst all top grade saint artifacts. This was also within reason. Although the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s inheritances varied with all sorts of weapons in use, the most common weapons were swords and spears.

There were many female disciples in the Ancient Phoenix Clan and the vast majority of them preferred to use swords. As for spears, because the Ancient Phoenix Clan waged war against many other sects in ancient times, they had to ride colossal firebirds and golden crows. During those dire times, a spear would be far more convenient than a sword.

“It’s a wonderful spear.” Lin Ming couldn’t help but praise.

“Naturally, if we could obtain such a top grade saint artifact, that’d be awesome; I have no idea just how much our strength would increase. Moreover, the top grade saint artifacts all have the Laws of the Great Dao inscribed into them. If you can perceive them through meditation, it will be greatly beneficial.” A disciple standing next to Lin Ming said, a besotted look on his face.

“Dream on! You’re far from being qualified to obtain a top grade saint artifact. Only Senior-apprentice Brother Huang has such a chance.” Another male disciple ruthlessly poked apart the disciple’s daydreams.

“Oh, that’s right, Senior-apprentice Brother Huang, did you come this time to take a top grade saint artifact?” A female disciple echoed.

Huang Yuegong chuckled as he heard this question. He swung his fan and said, “That’s right, this time I indeed came for the several top grade saint artifacts. As for those high-grade saint artifacts, although they are precious, I do not lack them.”

“It’s just that, the top grade saint artifacts are far too difficult to obtain. Whether it’s the Sunpierce Sword or the Phoenix Blood Spear, both are extraordinary specimens of top grade saint artifacts, nearing the existence of transcendent saint artifacts. Even for me, I only have a 30% chance of success.”

“Even Senior-apprentice Brother Huang has just a 30% chance of success?” A disciple said with a wide open mouth.

Song Baifeng humphed, “What do you know? I have guarded the Saint Artifact Pavilion for so many years and no one has managed to take the Sunpierce Sword or the Phoenix Blood Spear. They are true top grade saint artifacts! You must know that even most disciples of Phoenix Hall use medium-grade saint artifacts, not high-grade saint artifacts. Those that can use high-grade saint artifacts are truly outstanding individuals within the Phoenix Hall!”

Song Baifeng’s flattery had reached perfection. Every word he spoke aimed to bring up Huang Yuegong, making him enjoy it very much.

However, what Song Baifeng said was also the truth. Most Phoenix Hall disciples used medium-grade saint artifacts. The disciples managed to enter Phoenix Hall after breaking into the Divine Transformation realm and then undergoing a strict test. As for those that directly entered Phoenix Hall by crossing through nine stages of Life Destruction, that was a minority.

“Senior-apprentice Brother Huang, show us your prodigious skills!” A female disciple said.

“Yeah, let us open our eyes!” Several disciples quickly repeated. Huang Yuegong swung his fan, thinking for a moment before snapping it shut. “I suppose I will try again this time. Although I made sufficient preparations this time, the truth is my chances aren’t too great. A top grade saint artifact really is too hard to obtain.”

“Junior-apprentice Sister Jun. how about we try taking a treasure together?”

Huang Yuegong said to Jun Yunrue.

“Mm, alright.”

At this time, Jun Yunrue had also found a saint artifact she liked; it was a sword, a medium-grade saint artifact. In fact, it was at the peak of medium-grade saint artifacts.

Jun Yunrue and Huang Yuegong flew up at the same time. Jun Yunrue flew toward the sword saint artifact while Huang Yuegong approached the top grade Sunpierce Sword.

The Sunpierce Sword’s light was in no way inferior to the Phoenix Blood Spear. Compared to the top grade saint artifact ring or saint artifact vestment, it was much more brilliant! As the several disciples saw Huang Yuegong fly toward the Sunpierce Sword, all of their eyes turned wide, including Song Baifeng’s. They steadily locked their eyes on the sky lest they miss a single moment of glory.

Puff!

Like a fish jumping into the sea, Huang Yuegong was directly sucked into the scorching sun that was the Sunpierce Sword, disappearing without a trace.

As for Jun Yunrue, she flew into the medium-grade sword’s light to start the test of Saint Artifact Pavilion.

The other disciples eagerly waited. They looked at that blazing sun in the air, awe and expectation etched on their faces.

“Junior-apprentice Sister Lin, what did you encounter when you took that low-grade saint artifact?” A fellow disciple, Zhang, asked. He never attempted taking a treasure before.

Lin Junzhi said, “It was a complex test. Those saint artifact stars seem to have their own world within them. Senior-apprentice Sister Jun and Senior-apprentice Brother Huang are both attempting to take saint artifacts at a much higher grade, so the difficulty of their test should be far more difficult than mine.”

As Lin Junzhi spoke her eyes never left the star that Jun Yunrue vanished into. She hoped with all of her heart that Jun Yunrue would be able to pass the test and obtain the saint artifact.

Time slowly passed. Fifteen minutes flew by. The light of the two saint artifact stars in the sky began to shine increasingly bright. Lin Ming silently looked, carefully branching out his sensation and remembering the faint changes within the characteristics of the light. He could faintly feel that the every saint artifact star that floated in the sky was in truth part of a great array formation, and each saint artifact served as the eye of that array. This array formation was incomparably mysterious; Lin Ming could only speculate.

He suddenly thought of something and asked Song Baifeng, “Could there be 9999 treasures within Saint Artifact Pavilion?”

Song Baifeng glanced at Lin Ming with some shock. He said, “That’s right, there’s exactly 9999 saint artifacts. 9000 low-grade saint artifacts, 900 medium-grade saint artifacts, 90 high-grade saint artifacts, and 9 top grade saint artifacts.”

The Ancient Phoenix Clan worshipped and revered the number nine. Nine divided by nine was one and to pass nine was to return to one; this was a symbol of a phoenix being reborn through nirvana.

Nine was the extreme numeral; it in itself contained the principles of the Great Dao.

Saint Artifact Pavilion was in truth a low-grade spirit artifact. At its core, these 9999 saint artifacts composed a great array formation. Once a saint artifact was taken by a disciple, Phoenix Cry Palace would add in a new one to ensure that the total number of saint artifacts in the Saint Artifact Pavilion would always be the same.

Lin Ming understood more and more of this great array formation’s mysteries as he watched. He unconsciously sunk his thoughts into comprehending it. At this time, he suddenly heard a light sound in the air. He looked up and saw that Jun Yunrue was ejected from the star in the sky that shimmered like a moon. Her complexion was flushed red as she landed on the ground.

“Senior-apprentice Sister Jun, how was it?”

Several disciples quickly circled her.

Although Jun Yunrue’s breath was a bit rapid and she consumed a great deal of energy, her eyes were actually filled with excitement. She didn’t reply to everyone’s questions, instead looking up at the sky. After several breaths of time, the star in the sky began to gradually dim down, converging in on itself until it became a coldly shining treasure sword that fell down.

Zing –

As the treasure sword fell into Jun Yunrue’s hand, it released a clarion cry.

Jun Yunrue successfully obtained the saint artifact!

“Congratulations senior-apprentice sister, congratulations!” Several disciples shouted out, overcome with happiness but also envy. This was a medium-grade saint artifact! Besides the elite disciples of Phoenix Hall, the others usually only had low-grade saint artifacts.

Jun Yunrue was currently only in Golden Crow Hall, soon to rise to Vermillion Bird Hall, but she managed to obtain a medium-grade saint artifact already. Once she entered Phoenix Hall, there was a high chance she would be able to obtain a high-grade saint artifact!

“Senior-apprentice Sister is fierce, you actually managed to obtain a medium-grade saint artifact sword. Senior-apprentice Sister’s strength will surely rise a great deal in the future!”

“That’s right, haha, with senior-apprentice sister supporting us in the future, we can surely move undaunted!”

As several disciples gleefully rejoiced, Jun Yunrue also couldn’t conceal the euphoria on her face. “Alright, alright, that’s enough flattery. If you all can display enough talent that Honorable Master Fairy Feng will admire your ability, she will surely reward you. At that time, what would a mere medium-grade saint artifact be worth?”

Jun Yunrue glanced at everyone. At this time, the burning sun that was the Sunpierce Sword began to violently tremble.

Everyone was startled. They looked up and heard an explosive sound as that sun burst out with a light ten times brighter than before. In that moment, someone was thrown out from the blazing sun; it was Huang Yuegong.

After Huang Yuegong was ejected, the blazing sun’s light gradually weakened down before returning to normal several breaths later.

“Senior-apprentice Brother Huang!”

“Senior-apprentice Brother Huang are you okay!?”

Several disciples quickly went over to help him as they saw him being tossed onto the ground. In particular, Song Baifeng was the most attentive. He faithfully rushed over to give him mouth to mouth.

“Young Master! Young Master!” Huang Yuegong’s two lackeys arrived at his side like a bolt of lightning. They quickly took out all sorts of pills from their spatial ring, prepared to force feed him.

“What are you all freaking out for, I haven’t died yet!”

Huang Yuegong was enraged with shame. He shoved away the two lackeys that were trying to push pills in his mouth and looked at the Sunpierce Sword star in the air, his face darkening. It still hung there as before, continuing to dazzle like a sun with heavenly light, like a proud divine god that was looking down at the world, mocking all the mortals that presumptuously bit off more than they could chew.

“This damned sword!” Huang Yue indignantly spouted out. His eyes flashed with an ominous light. He came here today with great hopes of obtaining this treasure, but now he failed to obtain the sword and also lost face, especially since it was in front of Jun Yunrue. He wanted to use this chance to impress and conquer Jun Yunrue, but now his face swept the floor.

As he looked at Jun Yunrue, he could see that she managed to obtain the sword she tried for. This caused Huang Yuegong to be even more ashamed. Today, three people tried to obtain a saint artifact and only he failed.

Song Baifeng was looking at the situation and saw Huang Yuegong’s dilemma. He quickly said, “Sir Huang is fierce to face the Sunpierce Sword for half an hour. I’ve guarded Saint Artifact Pavilion for 30 years and the number of people that could withstand half an hour within the light of the Sunpierce Sword can be counted on two hands!”

Song Baifeng could be considered as restoring a bit of Huang Yuegong’s face. Although Huang Yuegong knew that Song Baifeng was clearly spouting drivel, he tacitly allowed him to do so.

Chapter 959 – Towards the Phoenix Blood Spear

…

…

…

“Sir Huang, would you like to try taking a high-grade saint artifact? Saint Artifact Pavilion has many high-grade saint artifacts that are of a very high quality. Although they cannot compare to the nine top grade saint artifacts, they are still quite formidable. With Sir Huang’s strength, taking a high-grade saint artifact should be no problem at all!” Song Baifeng improvised some advice on the spot as he saw Huang Yuegong’s face being swept all over the ground.

A high-grade saint artifact and a top grade saint artifact were different in terms of value by over a hundred times; they were on two completely different levels. Huang Yuegong certainly didn’t want to take a high-grade saint artifact, but taking a top grade saint artifact was easier said than done. What Saint Artifact Pavilion tested was talent and potential; these two factors normally wouldn’t change much no matter how high a martial artist’s cultivation grew. If there wasn’t some great lucky chance, then even if Huang Yuegong cultivated to the Divine Transformation realm and returned to attempt taking a top grade saint artifact again, the result would likely more or less be the same.

He thought of this, then glanced at Jun Yunrue. He stood up and said, “Okay, as a disciple of Phoenix Hall, I can take two saint artifacts from Saint Artifact Pavilion. Since I haven’t taken any before, I can take a high-grade saint artifact as my first and the Sunpierce Sword as my second!”

Since it was far too difficult to obtain a top grade saint artifact at this time, he might as well take a high-grade saint artifact to recover some of the face he lost here. Otherwise, as a chosen pride of the heavens who had an unfathomable image to his junior-apprentice brothers and sisters and as someone who was revered and respected by so many, if his only memory of this place were to be being flung to the ground almost vomiting blood after failing to retrieve a saint artifact, then that really would be too shameful.

He decided to try a second time. In Saint Artifact Pavilion, every attempt was 1000 phoenix cry seal marks. Of course, with his status, Song Baifeng wouldn’t pursue this matter at all.

Huang Yuegong looked at the numerous saint artifacts in the sky and said, “Of the high-grade saint artifacts, I have a sword, a vestment, and a ring. What I’m still missing is a pill furnace!”

He settled on a star that shined like a full moon. He directly rushed up and submerged into that light!

Just from how bright the light was one could extrapolate that the pill furnace Huang Yuegong wanted to take was a peak high-grade saint artifact. Between high-grade saint artifacts, there was a massive difference in value between the best and the worst. If he could obtain a peak high-grade saint artifact, it would be of great help to enhance his strength.

“As expected of Senior-apprentice Brother Huang, he immediately chooses such a fierce treasure. I can’t believe that this is his alternate to the Sunpierce Sword.”

“That’s right, this is a boundary that we can’t imagine.”

The disciples beside Jun Yunrue felt ashamed at their own weakness. They could only barely manage to obtain a low-grade saint artifact.

After Huang Yuegong sunk into the bright moon-like star, the light became increasingly dazzling until it began emitting beams of golden light that seemed like they could cut apart the void.

After an incense stick of time passed, Huang Yuegong calmly flew out from the shining light. He stretched his hand out and the shining light began to rapidly shrink until it fell into his palm where it spun around.

The light continued to converge. After several breaths of time, that brilliant light turned into a small, ordinary seeming bronze furnace.

“He did it!”

“Completely mind-blowing! A high-grade saint artifact was taken just like that in five minutes. Senior-apprentice Brother Huang is so fierce!”

This shocked all of the young disciples present. Jun Yunrue was already so strong but even she found it difficult to obtain a medium-grade saint artifact.

Huang Yuegong obtained a high-grade saint artifact with such ease. In terms of potential and talent, they were on completely different levels.

“This is incredible. Senior-apprentice Brother Huang is so amazing and yet he can’t obtain the Sunpierce Sword. Just how much stronger is the Sunpierce Sword!?”

“No kidding. There’s even several more top grade saint artifacts. I wonder just what sort of monster would be able to obtain them.”

“It’s already good if I can reach Senior-apprentice Brother Huang’s level. There really is no way I can compare!”

The several young disciples all exclaimed out loud. From listening to their compliments, Huang Yuegong’s face finally improved some.

He casually threw the furnace to his lackeys and deliberately said in his most casual tone, “Hold it for me. It should be of some use when I’m practicing alchemy later. It’s a decent transition furnace for me.”

Transition?

As the several young disciples heard this word, they were left speechless. Such an extraordinary pill furnace was actually just a transitory item for others. Really, comparing oneself to others could aggravate someone to death.

Song Baifeng laughed, “Sir Huang is indeed Sir Huang. This is a peak high-grade saint artifact called the Triple Shroud Divine Furnace. Although this furnace isn’t a top grade saint artifact, it isn’t too far off!”

Song Baifeng continued to flatter again and again. Huang Yuegong only laughed. Since others were busy repairing his reputation with gold, he certainly wouldn’t stop them.

“It’s fine. Although I didn’t manage to obtain the Sunpierce Sword this time, I still managed to take this Triple Shroud Divine Furnace. It’s adequate. Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, do you plan on leaving now? How about we head out together?” Huang Yuegong felt as if he had restored enough of the face he lost, and now his words were much more gallant than before. He invited Jun Yunrue out once again.

Jun Yunrue faintly smiled. “Senior-apprentice Brother Huang, we can leave on our own in a bit. But I brought Junior-apprentice Brother Lin here and he hasn’t tried obtaining a treasure yet.”

“Oh? Junior-apprentice Brother Lin?” Huang Yuegong recalled that Lin Ming hadn’t yet taken a treasure. The memory of a Divine Sea martial artist was outstanding; they wouldn’t forget something they wanted to remember. The only reason Huang Yuegong had forgotten about this matter was because he had directly taken Lin Ming as an attendant and ignored him.

“It’s no problem. Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, I’ll wait for you.” Huang Yuegong glanced at Lin Ming and impatiently said, “This junior-apprentice brother, hurry up.”

As Huang Yuegong and Jun Yunrue spoke, everyone’s eyes turned to Lin Ming. Lin Ming ignored Huang Yuegong as he looked up at the sky, his eyes passing over the nine top grade saint artifacts one at a time. He asked the guard captain Song Baifeng, “Senior Song, is there a limit to what grade saint artifact we can attempt to take depending on what hall we are in? Or can we choose whichever we like.”

“Of course. You can choose whichever you like as long as you have the ability to do so. Do you want to return to the entrance? The worst saint artifact here are medium-grade saint artifacts. The low-grade saint artifacts are near the edge.” Song Baifeng casually said as he looked over to Lin Ming.

“No need.” Lin Ming faintly smiled. “Here is fine.”

“Oh? You are quite confident in yourself. Did you ascend from the lower realms? You martial artists that ascend from the lower realms are normally far too confident when you first come to the Divine Realm. You will slowly understand just how terrifying the Divine Realm is and what your place within it is too. Every attempt here will cost you 1000 phoenix cry seal marks, so don’t blame me for not reminding you.” Song Baifeng sized up Lin Ming, waiting for him to back down. Those disciples that ascended from the lower realms were usually the top masters of their own great world and correspondingly arrogant. But compared to the geniuses of the Divine Realm, they were far from being comparable.

“Senior-apprentice Sister Jun, it might be a bit difficult for Junior-apprentice Brother Lin to take a saint artifact from here.” Lin Junzhi whispered to Jun Yunrue. She already obtained a saint artifact so she knew how difficult the test was.

“It shouldn’t be a problem. Don’t forget that Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is someone who Honorable Master values highly. Taking a medium-grade saint artifact shouldn’t be a problem for him at all.” Jun Yunrue believed in Lin Ming. Or rather, it was better to say that she believed in Fairy Feng’s judgment. She turned to Lin Ming and said, “Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, don’t be nervous. It’s good enough if you can bring out your true strength. Pick something that you like.”

“Thank you senior-apprentice sister. Well, I guess it’s my turn.”

Lin Ming rose into the sky, his feet stepping on Golden Roc Shattering the Void. His movements were erratic and ghostly as he passed through the many medium-grade saint artifacts and arrived at the height of the high-grade saint artifacts!

Here, the medium-grade saint artifacts floated at the lowest position in the sky. The high-grade saint artifacts were above them, and finally the top-grade saint artifacts were located at the zenith of this space.

“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, could he be planning on taking a high-grade saint artifact?” Lin Junzhi’s large and watery black eyes widened. Before she finished speaking, Lin Ming had already passed the height of the high-grade saint artifacts and reached the highest point of this space!

That was the elevation of the top grade saint artifacts!

“What!?”

“What is he planning on doing?”

It wasn’t just Lin Junzhi that was surprised, but even Jun Yunrue was watching with widened eyes. She stared blankly on as Lin Ming flew towards the nine top grade saint artifacts.

His goal was the Phoenix Blood Spear!

The light of the Phoenix Blood Spear was even bright than the Sunpierce Sword. It was the peak existence amongst all nine top grade saint artifacts, approaching a transcendent saint artifact!

Did Lin Ming really choose the Phoenix Blood Spear?

Or perhaps he was curious and just wanted to take a closer look?

Lin Ming was extremely fast. Jun Yunrue didn’t even have time to respond before Lin Ming rushed in front of the blazing sun that was the Phoenix Blood Spear. Moreover, he didn’t seem to be slowing down at all; he wanted to rush directly at it!

Jun Yunrue, Lin Junzhi, and the others were all bewildered. Even Song Baifeng and Huang Yuegong were stunned with disbelief. Their expressions were replaced with silly looks as they watched Lin Ming.

“Is he crazy?” Huang Yuegong sneered. This Lin Ming was simply a madman. Although the test wasn’t life-threatening, if the disparity was too great then he might possibly injure his soul. Even he couldn’t obtain a top grade saint artifact and yet this Lin Ming actually wanted to try taking one like an idiot. Did he even look in the mirror?

“How perversely incredible, I thought that martial artists that ascended from the lower realms were reckless, but I’ve never seen one like this.” Song Baifeng was at a loss for words. Martial artists that ascended from the lower realms tended to be crazy at the start, but no matter how crazy they were they were still somewhat smart. This Lin Ming, on the other hand, was just brain dead.

Puff!

Lin Ming directly sank into the most dazzling light.

Everyone on the ground was stricken, their eyes like full moons. They never thought a scene like this would occur.

Huang Yuegong queerly smiled. “Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, this junior-apprentice brother of yours is quite, quite special.”

Huang Yuegong emphasized the last word. In front of Jun Yunrue, in order to maintain his image, he naturally wouldn’t say any words that would embarrass her. After all, she was the one that brought Lin Ming here.

However, Song Baifeng didn’t have such qualms. He laughed and said, “Sir Huang is too polite. In the words of us coarse people, they call this ‘forced by a large tiger’. Someone that is truly an idiot and ignores all consequences to rush in. Haha, that is just too suitable for him.”

Huang Yuegong smiled at Song Baifeng’s words. He waved his fan several times.

As for Jun Yunrue, she blushed red, extremely embarrassed. The other young disciples also weren’t feeling too good. Lin Ming hadn’t given them any hint at all and had rushed straight toward the Phoenix Blood Spear. This was simply beyond their expectations.

Chapter 960 – Test

…

…

…

Of the nine top grade saint artifacts, the Phoenix Blood Spear, the Sunpierce Sword, and the Sun Shooting Bow were of the highest quality. The Phoenix Blood Spear was faintly superior to the Sunpierce Sword; it could be considered the most powerful saint artifact here.

As for the ring, the necklace, the vestment, and so forth, because they were defensive or accessory types saint artifacts, their supposed value should be higher. However, due to fact that their quality was far inferior to the Phoenix Blood Spear, there was no way to compare the actual value.

On Lin Ming’s first attempt, he actually went toward the most precious of the nine top grade saint artifacts. How could this not cause everyone’s eyes to bulge out of their heads?

“That idiot, I estimate that he will last 10 breaths at most.” A lackey laughed out loud from behind Huang Yuegong.

“10 breaths is overestimating him too much. I think five breaths is his limit and his soul will also be damaged in the test, possibly affecting his future cultivation.” Another lackey guffawed. In front of them, Huang Yuegong only swung his fan, smiling without speaking.

“If his cultivation is affected, then it’s affected. In any case, rotten wood cannot be made into a carving.”

As the two lackeys bantered with each other, five breaths of time soon passed. Shortly after, 7-8 breaths of time passed. However, the light of the Phoenix Blood Spear only grew brighter, showing no signs of dimming down.

“Five breaths of time have passed already.” Jun Yunrue coldly said. While she did think that Lin Ming was a bit too reckless in going straight for the Phoenix Blood Spear, she wasn’t going to let Huang Yuegong’s hanger-ons belittle Lin Ming like this. After all, Lin Ming was someone that Fairy Feng placed in high esteem. Even if he couldn’t take a top grade saint artifact, taking a medium-grade saint artifact shouldn’t be a problem; he might even have a chance of obtaining a high-grade saint artifact. As for a top grade saint artifact, it wouldn’t be too unseemly as long as he could withstand the test for some time.

“Haha, it seems I spoke too soon. This Junior-apprentice Brother Lin really does seem as if he can last for 10 breaths of time.” The lackey that said Lin Ming would only last for five breaths of time laughed. But as he spoke, another two breaths of time passed. Ten breaths of time passed in total.

The lackey frowned. The words he had just spoke were tossed back in his face, and his complexion became ugly. However, following that:

11 breaths of time.

12 breaths of time.

13 breaths of time…

As time passed one breath at a time, the faces of the two lackeys became increasingly ugly. Someone that could stay in the dazzling light of a top grade saint artifact was indeed a top character. They would be able to at least enter Vermillion Bird Hall. This proved that Lin Ming’s talent surpassed the both of them.

Of course, compared to someone like Huang Yuegong who was even ranked in the upper echelons of Phoenix Hall, this sort of talent was still far from being enough. Huang Yuegong swung his fan and smiled, “You too have looked down on others too much. The junior-apprentice brother that Junior-apprentice Sister Jun brought here is quite good. After raising him a bit, it’s a settled matter for him to enter Vermillion Bird Hall; he even has some hopes of entering Phoenix Hall. At that time, he will be considered my junior-apprentice brother. I will help him out so that he won’t have to struggle too much. For someone that ascended from the lower realms, their vision, inheritance, and Concepts will inevitably be lacking.”

Huang Yuegong pleasantly smiled, casually taking the role of a senior directing a junior. He appeared open-minded as if he were a likable elder senior-apprentice brother.

Jun Yunrue said, “Then I’ll thank Senior-apprentice Brother Huang in place of Junior-apprentice Brother Lin.”

The disciple surnamed Zhang hurriedly added in, “Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is really lucky. With Senior-apprentice Brother Huang’s guidance, his cultivation will definitely soar.”

“Haha, no need speak such flattery.” Huang Yuegong smirked. As they spoke, 20 breaths of time had already passed.

20 breaths of time already faintly and steadily surpassed their expectations.

But it didn’t end there.

This was followed by:

30 breaths of time.

35 breaths of time…

Huang Yuegong looked up at the Phoenix Blood Spear in the sky, his eyes flashing with surprise. This ordinary martial artist from the lower realms was actually able to last inside the test for such a long time?

As for the two lackeys that were previously mocking Lin Ming, they were already stunned silent. Song Baifeng was also dumbfounded. He guarded Saint Artifact Pavilion for many years, and certainly understood just what lasting 35 breaths of time meant.

Saint Artifact Pavilion was in itself a spirit artifact. It could change the flow of time in its inner world, reaching degrees of 10:1 or even 100:1. Lin Ming was in the test for 35 breaths of time, but the truth was he might have already been tested for half an hour.

Even an ordinary Phoenix Hall disciple could only support themselves for around this period of time. This was proof that after reaching the Divine Transformation, Lin Ming would enter Phoenix Hall and become a true core disciple!

If Lin Ming could hold on longer, that meant he would have chances of obtaining a high-grade saint artifact. That was a high-grade saint artifact! Song Baifeng guarded Saint Artifact Pavilion for so many years, accumulating a great deal of wealth from extortion and blackmail, but he still didn’t have something as luxurious as a high-grade saint artifact.

This brat just rushed toward the Phoenix Blood Spear without a word. He thought this Lin Ming that ascended from the lower realms was a hot-blooded, stupid youth, but he never imagined he would really be so fierce.

“Junior-apprentice Brother is this strong?” The young disciples around Jun Yunrue glanced at each other, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“No wonder Honorable Master values him so highly. Although he is someone that ascended from the lower realms, he is still far more powerful than we are.”

“Yeah. It’s 40 breaths of time already. Even if Junior-apprentice Brother Lin fails now, it’s still a result to be proud of,” Lin Junzhi said, her wide eyes filled with envy as they were glued onto that brilliant light in the sky.

“Not bad, indeed not bad. He is quite the good material.” Huang Yuegong swung his fan, a reluctant smile on his face. He was still able to keep his calm at this time. After all, he lasted in the light of the Sunpierce Sword for fifteen minutes. It was far from what the mere 40 breaths of Lin Ming could compare with.

As everyone was speaking, Lin Ming had already entered a vast white world.

Saint Artifact Pavilion was a world that had more worlds within. Of the 9999 saint artifacts within Saint Artifact Pavilion, each had their own individual world which differed in size depending on their grade.

The Phoenix Blood Spear world that Lin Ming was at was an especially large world. It was about the size of the Forsaken God Clan’s dimensional realm.

In the skies above this world, a huge face emerged. The skies for several hundred miles out gathered together to form this face. Lin Ming could feel a vast aura emitting from it, startling him.

He had only ever felt this type of atmosphere from Fairy Feng. However, Fairy Feng’s aura was far more formidable than the one from this massive floating face.

At this moment, the giant floating face opened its mouth, and a loud and endless voice poured out like a rolling thunderclap. “27 year skeletal age, peak fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation. Placed among the several hundred million disciples and subjects of Phoenix Cry Palace, this cultivation cannot be considered at the peak. However, it is still first class. Coupled with an unknown strength that resides in your body, you have earned the qualifications for me to personally test you.”

“You are Saint Artifact Pavilion’s temple spirit?” Lin Ming’s thoughts stirred as he asked this. The words of this spirit gave Lin Ming a new understanding into Phoenix Cry Palace. To have a peak fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation at 27 still couldn’t be considered at the peak. This meant that there were those at his age who had an even higher cultivation!

It had to be known that Phoenix Cry Palace was only one of the 72 palaces of the Ancient Phoenix Clan. Within the Divine Realm, the entire Ancient Phoenix Clan combined was only a grain of sand in a vast desert, simply not worth mentioning. From the looks of things, his own cultivation speed wasn’t anything special at all. But speed of cultivation didn’t fully represent one’s talent.

Lin Ming was a dual body and essence cultivator, and he also had the Heretical God Seed and Magic Cube within him. His foundation was extremely solid, his grandmist battle spirit neared silver perfection, and he even had a portion of the Primordius martial intent. All of this together made him someone that a normal genius of the Divine Realm couldn’t compare with.

Even facing the vast Divine Realm with the endless and infinite young heroic elites that gushed forth, Lin Ming did not fear any challenger!

“Young man, you are quite smart. Yes, I am indeed Saint Artifact Pavilion’s temple spirit. Or, to be more accurate, I am the artifact spirit. Saint Artifact Pavilion is a spirit artifact and I am the artifact spirit. You’re not bad at all. Not every trial challenger has the qualifications for me to personally appear, but you, you suffice. I will oversee your test and create a test suitable to your skeletal age. If you pass, you may take the Phoenix Blood Spear.”

As this massive face spoke, Lin Ming felt his surroundings suddenly change. He arrived above an endless sea of fire. The flames were limitless, infinite, extending to the endless horizons. The ground was an ocean of lava and in the skies were crimson meteors both large and small. The crimson meteors were bred from burning fire essence energy. They constantly grew in the skies, and once they gained enough size and strength they would fall downwards, bringing with it a trailing tail of flame. Once they crashed they would tear the earth apart, creating a limitless storm of annihilating fire!

This scene was quite familiar.

“This is the second world of the God Transforming Mirror – the space of annihilation. The world contains the second of the nine levels of Concepts within the Flame Laws – the Concept of Annihilation!

“Good. It seems you’ve entered the second world of the God Transforming Mirror before. I assume you did so during the second Ancient Phoenix smelting trial. However, the space of annihilation here is far more formidable than what you encountered at the second smelting trial. Prepare yourself to withstand the baptism of the Annihilation Laws.”

As the artifact spirit spoke, the massive face phantom slowly faded away. A several mile wide meteor that had been concealed behind this face rapidly plummeted through the fading face.

Bang bang bang!

Space trembled. If this several mile wide meteor fell onto the Sky Spill Continent, it would be enough to destroy a province and bring calamity to an entire nation. But now in front of Lin Ming, this was only the first attack!

Lin Ming grasped the Great Desolate Blood Halberd and pointed the halberd blade at the skies. Within his pupils, the image of phantom flames began to flicker, blazing and burning.

When Lin Ming as at Timeworn Phoenix City, he studied the Concept of Fire textures from the Burning Heaven Totem Stone. Now those textures reappeared within his mind one at a time. A trace of a mysterious Concept began to appear in his mind, as if he were gaining insights and faintly becoming aware of something.

Law of Annihilation, Chain of Stars!

Lin Ming roared out and the lava became a massive wave that rose 1000 feet into the skies. The blood halberd in Lin Ming’s hands was like a red divine dragon as it rocketed toward the heavens.

A 10,000 foot long beam of crimson light smashed into the red meteor. It actually pierced through the red meteor and crushed it to pieces!

Bang bang bang!

That several mile wide meteor was split into 7-8 sections, all falling to the earth. Although it’s might was still astounding, it wasn’t able to harm Lin Ming in the slightest.

Chapter 961 – Break the World

…

…

…

As the meteor crashed into the earth, lava splashed into the skies. But in this chaos, Lin Ming was actually like a fish in water.

After the first meteor exploded, the second meteor followed immediately after, then the third, the fourth…

More and more meteors plummeted toward the world. They were beams of brilliant light that covered the sky. When Lin Ming was within the God Transforming Mirror in Timeworn Phoenix City, the meteors dropped down one at a time. But now, dozens of meteors fell together as if the apocalypse had arrived!

Amongst these meteors, besides the miles wide meteors, there were also those that were only the size of a fist. To all common sense, these sorts of mini meteors shouldn’t pose any threat to Lin Ming. But the truth was just the opposite. These mini meteors were even more dangerous to Lin Ming.

These mini meteors were a hundred times faster than the larger meteors. Moreover, they contained an incomparably destructive energy and also contained the Annihilation Laws of pure fire. Every mini meteor was the same as an explosive missile. Every time one fell to the earth, a convulsive detonation would follow!

Bang!

A fist sized meteor exploded less than 100 feet from Lin Ming. Lin Ming’s protective true essence was attacked by the meteor’s shockwave. With a series of snapping sounds, cracks began to appear in his protective true essence!

At this moment, three meteors also fell down on all sides, each the size of a bowl. These three meteors were far too fast; they blocked off all directions for Lin Ming to escape, wanting to pin him to death.

“Golden Roc Shattering the Void!”

Lin Ming’s thoughts stirred. He wanted to use Space Distortion but he was surprised to discover that the space here was far too stable. In the lower realms, Lin Ming could cross several miles with a single step, but now crossing even a dozen feet was difficult.

“Mystic Lightning Shade!”

At this critical moment, the 12 thunder escape symbols within Lin Ming’s body erupted with a blazing light. He forcefully accelerated to the extreme speed of thunder. However, without the support of Space Distortion, his speed wasn’t comparable to those bowl sized meteors.

A meteor exploded close to where Lin Ming was.

Bang!

Lin Ming violently shook as his protective true essence exploded. Wild fire energy rampantly stampeded into his body. It directly tore apart his clothes, which were formed from thunder silk, and began ravaging his meridians!

This fire energy was filled with the terrifying aura of the Law of Annihilation. Lin Ming’s complexion paled and he nearly spat out a mouthful of blood.

Even the Heretical God Sprout wasn’t able to immediately suppress such a crazy and potent fire energy; it required some time to do so. The raging energy of the meteor was simply too ferocious; it caused Lin Ming to receive some minor damage to his meridians.

In this land like hell where there was nothing but scenes of destruction, Lin Ming fell into a trap of flames! A crazy fire carried with it an annihilating aura as it rushed toward him. Above Lin Ming was a barrier of meteors and underneath him were endless flames. Lin Ming couldn’t even use Space Distortion; there was nowhere for him to evade!

As Lin Ming was soon about to be engulfed by this devastating fire, he loudly shouted out and a red lotus flower suddenly bloomed behind him.

Heavenly Demon martial intent – grandmist space!

Grandmist was infinity. Infinity gave birth to the primal chaos, and the primal chaos transformed into yin and yang. First there was grandmist, then there was primal chaos, after primal chaos was the division of yin and yang, and finally there was the formation of the five elements. The Fire Laws was one of these five elements. Within the grandmist space that extinguished all Laws, it would naturally be restrained!

Ssssss!

Underneath the cover of the grandmist space, the flames rapidly melted away!

“Break for me!”

Lin Ming took this chance and swung his halberd. The 800,000 jin Great Desolate Blood Halberd carried Lin Ming’s full strength, falling down like an avalanche from heaven.

The waves of flames as high as a mountain were directly split apart by the halberd!

“Blood of the Ancient Phoenix, combust!”

After breaking through these choppy waves of flames, a golden light began shining from between Lin Ming’s eyebrows, emitting a glorious and majestic light. A golden phoenix phantom formed behind him, appearing as if it would fuse with the world.

Ca – !

The flame phoenix cried out, directly soaring into the endless skies. All of the surrounding fire energy was mixed up by this phoenix, turning into a storm of flames.

Lin Ming fused together with the flame phoenix. He pointed his blood halberd towards the skies where the countless meteors were.

Reverse the Chain of Stars!

The boundless grandmist battle spirit converged with the halberd light, bringing with it the power of chaos that annihilated all Laws as it crashed into the chain of meteors in the sky.

Within the second world of the God Transforming World, the chain of stars that was formed from countless stones actually revolved according to some mysterious rule. And the chain of stars in Saint Artifact Pavilion was also the same.

In the skies, countless pieces of stones stuck together, slowly condensing into new meteors, some of which were fist-sized mini meteors that dazzled with a flaming light. Although these mini meteors were small, they were extremely dangerous. As for meteors that were dimmer, they were slower but also became giant meteors with great destructive power.

These meteors all floated in a seething fog of fire. As long as they meteors were fully formed, they would be thrust down under the support of the annihilating energy.

This was not the first time that Lin Ming encountered the space of annihilation. The strange patterns of revolution within the stones and flames were reflected in his eyes. His attack was to be aimed at the crux of the rules of revolution!

“Break!”

Lin Ming shouted out loud. On top of the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, the power of fire gathered into a red dao diagram. The Purple Lion Thunder Source absorbed into the Heretical God Seed also howled as it rushed out, forming out a larger, mightier purple dao diagram in the air.

The two dao diagrams fused into one. A terrifying thunderfire energy exploded outward. This energy gathered into a raging torrent of thunderfire that directly interrupted the revolving route of the chain of stars!

As the revolving route shattered, there was a crackling sound as all of the meteors taking shape suddenly broke apart.

The chain of stars was forcefully ripped apart by Lin Ming. With it, the falling meteors became much less concentrated and the pressure on Lin Ming was reduced several times over.

“Mm?”

The artifact spirit that had been hiding within Saint Artifact Pavilion while viewing Lin Ming’s progress was shocked. “He broke the chain of stars! My original intention was that if he could withstand it for half an hour, it would be considered as passing the test of Concept. I never imagined he would be able to break the chain of stars!”

“But he did not rely on just the Fire Concepts to do this; his understandings into the Fire Concepts aren’t too extraordinary. The reason he could accomplish this is because he was able to fuse Thunder Concepts with Fire Concepts, as well as that mysterious force field. I wonder, just what is that force field? It was actually able to melt away the Fire Laws…”

Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit muttered. It didn’t know about the Primordius martial intent. Just what sort of existence was Empyrean Primordius? His status was even a level higher than a World King. He was one of the true top powerhouses of the entire Divine Realm! Within the entire Divine Realm, there were an extremely small number of people that could see an Empyrean. Even a character on the level of a World King or Holy Lord would find it extremely difficult to see an Empyrean. As for those that were actually able to see an Empyrean fight, they were a minority amongst minorities!

To the vast majority of martial artists in the Divine Realm, an Empyrean was a spiritual god, extremely mysterious and unrivalled. As for an Empyrean’s cultivation methods, abilities, or the limits of their strength, these were also enigmas that far surpassed the comprehension of mortals. If the Ancient Devil within Yang Yun hadn’t taken part in the great war 100,000 years ago and personally saw Empyrean Primordius slay armies with the Primordius martial intent, it would’ve been impossible for him to recognize that Lin Ming was also using the same martial intent.

As for Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit, although it had lived for countless tens of thousands of years, it was locked within Phoenix Cry Palace and had no way of coming into contact with a character like Empyrean Primordius. It couldn’t recognize the Primordius martial intent. But even so, it could feel that Lin Ming’s martial intent was terrifying.

“This child actually has such a mysterious force field martial intent on him. In addition to his cultivation, age, and solid foundation, his potential is truly terrifying. Moreover, it seems as if he is a martial artist that ascended from the lower realms. From the way he fought just now, he should have completed his dual body and essence cultivation and opened the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. To accomplish this in the lower realms where resources are so lacking is truly incredible!”

Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit was far more intelligent than the common man. It was able to instantly discern many things. If the nine stages of Life Destruction decided a martial artist’s future boundary, then Lin Ming’s martial intent, Laws, battle spirit, and dual body and essence cultivation played an immense role in deciding his comparative combat strength with other martial artists at his level. Those factors also played a great role in determining a martial artist’s future achievements.

“Dual body and essence cultivation, how many years has it been in Phoenix Cry Palace since someone decided to take this route. The body transformation path conflicts with Life Destruction. After body transformation, crossing Life Destruction becomes extremely difficult. As for the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace that follow the Eight Inner Hidden Gates, that is impossible. If one cannot break through the most essential Nine stars of the dao palace, then the effects of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates will be minimized when one reaches the late Divine Lord realm. It can almost be ignored afterward.

The artifact spirit thought like this and took a glimmer of interest in Lin Ming. It looked forward to seeing to what degree this junior would grow.

“Let me see what boundary your body transformation technique has reached. The second round of the test will be a test of your body transformation!”

Saint Artifact Pavilion’s tests were all decided by the artifact spirit. The artifact spirit itself was a martial arts grandmaster. All sorts of tests, including those that looked at Laws, perception, and so forth could be freely utilized by the artifact spirit.

Thanks to the long years of accumulation the artifact spirit had developed a near endless variety of testing methods. Many geniuses of Phoenix Hall were tortured by its tests to the brink of despair. As the artifact spirit saw these chosen prides of heaven being pushed into the ground, it was also overjoyed.

At this time, Lin Ming actually had no idea that he managed to arouse the interest of this old antiquity that already existed for countless tens of thousands of years. He could only feel the power of fire around him instantly vanish, and the chain of stars that roiled in the skies also disappeared.

Lin Ming took a deep breath, secretly thinking to himself, “The first round of the test only looks at the Concept of Fire and yet it is so difficult. I thought that I could rely on just my Concept of Fire to pass the test, but my results were far worse than what I imagined. I had no choice but to use the Concept of Thunder as well as the Heavenly Demon martial intent to break the chain of stars. This top grade saint artifact test that can even sweep the ground with top geniuses of the Divine Realm isn’t easy to pass at all!”

Lin Ming muttered. But he didn’t know that he would have passed the first round of tests as long as he was able to withstand it for half an hour. As for breaking the chain of stars, that was simply overdoing everything.

As Lin Ming was still in thoughts, the surrounding environment changed again. All of the heaven and earth origin energy was rapidly drained away!

All of the true essence in his dantian was locked down; it was unable to be moved at all.

“Hmm? What’s going on here?”

Chapter 962 – Totem Stone

…

…

…

“True essence was unusable?”

Lin Ming’s eyebrows shot up. He knew that the artifact spirit had sealed away his dantian by blocking off the connection between his spirit body’s true essence and soul.

This left him bewildered. He simply had no idea just what level of cultivation this artifact spirit had reached; it was as if it simply needed to wave its hand to accomplish this. Moreover, it was skilled in all sorts of array formations. Not to mention everything else, but just the 9999 saint artifacts that composed the main body of Saint Artifact Pavilion left Lin Ming floored. Although he was able to discern a faint trace of the great array formation’s mysteries, wanting to break through it was impossible.

“I can’t use true essence but I can still use my physical strength. Could this round be examining my body transformation technique?”

Lin Ming had some doubts about this. The Ancient Phoenix Clan did not cultivate body transformation techniques. It was more accurate to say that within the countless sects and family clans of the Divine Realm, there were far too few that bothered with training in body transformation. The inheritances were nearly lost because of this. Compared to the essence gathering system, there were simply far too many shortcomings and problems. One needed to consume a massive amount of resources, and the later it went the more difficult it would be to train in.

Undoubtedly, dual cultivating in body and essence was more formidable than solely following the essence gathering system. But the premise of this was that one’s body transformation technique was able to follow the essence gathering system. Otherwise, if one system were to far surpass the other, it would weaken until it was eventually useless.

As for cultivating just the essence gathering system, if one could train to the very peak then their power would also become unfathomable. For instance, Empyrean Primordius relied on just the essence gathering system to walk the entire Divine Realm unhindered. If one dual cultivated body and essence, it would be a major problem trying to reach the level of an Empyrean. Throughout the entire Divine Realm and the infinite lives that lived here, just how many people were able to become an Empyrean?

In this situation, Lin Ming didn’t think that Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit would actually test his body transformation technique. But at this moment, in front of Lin Ming, a great crowd of red-scaled divine cows appeared. These divine cows were all 20 feet tall and several times larger than the average cow. If an average cow were this size, they might weigh up to 10,000 jins. But these red divine cows had thick scales covering their entire bodies; they were at least 10 times heavier than a normal cow.

As this group of red divine cows appeared, they began to crazily stampede towards Lin Ming.

Lin Ming grasped the Great Desolate Blood Halberd and calmly stood still, watching the red-scaled divine cows wildly charge at him. The movement of true essence in his body was blocked now so he could only rely on his physical strength. This was a first for Lin Ming!

Rahh!

The red-scaled divine cows issued terrifying roars. These sounds didn’t seem like they came from cows but rather from giant tigers. As several hundred divine cows smashed their way toward him, their charging momentum broke through the heavens and caused the ground to tremble. Although these divine cows were only simulacrums produced by an array formation, there was no differentiating them from reality.

Lin Ming calmly watched the first red-scaled divine cow rush at him. Up until now, he had experienced countless battlefields and his combat experience was rich and varied. As the divine cow reached him, he did not flinch. Instead, he took a step forward, opening four Inner Hidden Gates at the same time, then smashed out with the 800,000 jin Great Desolate Blood Halberd. The blood halberd came falling down like a collapsing mountain!

Bang!

The 20 feet high divine cow that weighed several tens of thousands of jins, and was rushing forwards with a terrifying speed, was actually pounded into gooey flesh by Lin Ming’s halberd!

After obtaining the treasures from the Temple of Marvels, Lin Ming did not lack materials for medicine. As he practiced the essence gathering system, he didn’t forget to train in body transformation either. There was a large disparity between the fourth and fifth of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. Compared to opening the first four gates, the difficulty of opening the fifth gate rose to another level. After Lin Ming defeated Yang Yun, he had been saving his strength in preparation for opening the fifth of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. Although he hadn’t managed to do it so far, his strength already surpassed 2 million jins and was nearing 3 million jins.

If this massive strength was used to wield the 800,000 jin Great Desolate Blood Halberd and bring it smashing down, the destructive potential could be imagined!

Lin Ming’s eyes flashed with a bloodthirsty light. Using just his physical strength to beat a 100,000 jin divine cow to death unleashed his bestial side and ignited his fighting spirit.

Using one’s physical strength to fight was completely different from fighting with the support of true essence.

“Second one!”

Lin Ming shouted and pointed his halberd toward the belly of a second divine cow. His foot stepped back and the hard ground beneath his foot cracked apart. He lowered his waist and thrust both hands upward, instantly erupting with 3 million jins of strength.

A 100,000 jin divine cow was sent flying away be Lin Ming.

“Third one!”

Lin Ming was completely immersed in this hot-blooded battle. The Great Desolate Blood Halberd in his hands flew through the air. That 800,000 jin halberd combined with Lin Ming’s 3 million jins of strength was enough to split apart a divine cow upon contact!

The Great Desolate Blood Halberd had no flexibility to begin with. As Lin Ming constantly killed these divine cows, the shaking strength in the halberd shaft was also terrifying. All of this was completely withstood by Lin Ming.

If a normal martial artist had to withstand this terrifying shaking strength, their hands would have already been cracked open. But Lin Ming was able to rely on the regenerative power of the Gate of Healing to forcefully suppress it. Although his blood vitality was sent tumbling, this great strength also caused his blood to boil over with a brutal furor.

82.

83.

84…

Lin Ming killed his way through the divine cows. Blood rained down from the air, dying his entire body a bright blood red. He was someone that seemed as if they emerged from a pool of blood. The ground underneath his feet was wet with mixed flesh and blood, and every step he took left a deep indent.

191!

192!

As Lin Ming killed his way to the end, this slaughter had nearly become instinctive. He didn’t need to think at all. As long as a red-scaled divine cow rushed up to him, he was able to instantly respond and kill it!

As the artifact spirit watched all of this happen, it sighed in praise. It never imagined that Lin Ming’s achievements in body transformation would be so great. It seemed that Lin Ming’s body transforming was in no way left behind by the essence gathering system. The creation of his spirit body through Life Destruction was tempered by the body transformation technique, allowing both methods to complement each other.

“This child has already opened the fourth Gate of Pain of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. The Gate of Pain focusses on offensive strength. After the Gate of Pain is opened, the mortal strength of a martial artist will enter a period of explosive growth, until they reach 10 times their original strength. This child shouldn’t have any problems in completing the Eight Inner Hidden Gates, but if he wants to step into the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace, that is far too difficult.”

“The second test round can be considered as being perfectly passed.”

The artifact spirit muttered to itself. At this point it already confirmed Lin Ming’s potential and talent; he absolutely had the qualifications to obtain the Phoenix Blood Spear.

“Although these two test rounds have confirmed that you have the qualifications to obtain a top grade saint artifact, I will still test you one final time. I will test your martial arts will and perception; this can be considered giving you some good fortune. If you can pass this final test round to my satisfaction, then not only will I gift you the Phoenix Blood Spear but I will also bestow a fragment of energy and Laws that the previous Phoenix Cry Palace Master left here on the Phoenix Blood Spear, allowing its grade to come infinitely close to becoming a transcendent saint artifact.”

Lin Ming had no idea that the artifact spirit was making these plans. He continued to stand on the endless plains, his hand grasping the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, prepared to continue this life or death slaughterfest.

At this time, the countless red-scaled divine cows that rampaged over the boundless plains seemed to receive some sort of summoning call. They began to retreat like an ebbing tide. The several hundred corpses of red-scaled divine cows around Li Ming also vanished, and not a bit of flesh or blood was left on the ground.

Lin Ming took a deep breath. He knew he had passed the second round.

Following this, would there be a third?

As he was thinking, the ground in front of him suddenly trembled. A fissure spread through the earth, and with a loud rumbling sound, a massive stone tablet slowly rose into the world!

“Mm, this is…?” Lin Ming’s pupils focused. This stone tablet in front of him was 10 feet wide, 20 feet high, and five feet thick.

The surface of the stone tablet was covered with dense rows of flame runes. These flame runes were all different from each other, and from the bottom to the top, there was a gradual change in them. At the very bottom, the flame runes were small, appearing like beating flames. But as they rose, the flame runes turned into all sorts of weird lines that crawled over the stone tablet like a network of vines. Further up, those flame runes became abstract designs. Some designs looked like eyes, some looked like monsters, and some looked like ancient races.

“A chaos stone?”

Lin Ming was startled but immediately shook his head. When he was at Timeworn Phoenix City, he had the luck to see a tiny piece of a chaos stone. A chaos stone was formed at the beginning of the universe, and it became a naturally formed totem of chaos, with the traces of the universe’s source energy left on the chaos stone. A chaos stone was something that was pointed at the source of the Great Dao. If one could fully understand a chaos stone, they would be enlightened on the principles of revolution for the universe’s source energy. One could even become the person with the deepest comprehension of Laws in the entire divine Realm, becoming an existence on the level of an Empyrean!

The traces on a chaos stone were not so fine, but rather a bit rough. Those were traces formed from natural energy, with both deep and shallow grooves. They were unlike this stone tablet, with its delicate countless and diverse traces.

Without a doubt, this stone tablet was likely carved by some top Supreme Elder of the Ancient Phoenix Clan. It was highly possible that this Supreme Elder was a Patriarch of the Ancient Phoenix Clan.

Lin Ming had an approximate understanding into how high of a status the Patriarch had within the Ancient Phoenix Clan. Fairy Feng’s strength reached an unimaginable degree, but she was only the Vice Palace Master of Phoenix Cry Palace. Above a Vice Palace Master was a Palace Master, and a Palace Master was an Elder of the Ancient Phoenix Clan. With 72 palaces of the Ancient Phoenix Clan, that meant there were at least 72 Elders. Above these Elders was a Patriarch!

A Patriarch level character had left behind this stone tablet, and it was also at least 20 times larger than the carved stones in Timeworn Phoenix City. The value of this stone tablet could be imagined!

“The treatment in the Divine Realm is really different. If a Patriarch level character wants to inscribe their comprehension of Laws onto a stone tablet, they would inevitably have to spend an enormous amount of effort and time. In Timeworn Phoenix City, there were only three tiny pieces, each of them a square foot in size. Those simply cannot be compared to this stone tablet in Saint Artifact Pavilion. It looks like this test round is examining my perception.”

As a martial artist’s boundary grew, perception became more and more important. This was because perception was related to a martial artist’s understanding into the Heavenly Dao. As Lin Ming was thinking of this, his body suddenly shook. A vast will surged forth from the stone tablet, enveloping him within!

As this martial arts will covered him, Lin Ming felt an enormous oppression on his spiritual sea. As for the small spear-shaped battle spirit in his spiritual sea, it began to issues cries of excitement from the pressure.

“This is the will left behind in the stone tablet by an Ancient Phoenix Clan Patriarch?” Lin Ming realized just what this vast will, filled with great vigor, was.

Chapter 963 – Silver Perfection

…

…

…

“So that’s how it is. This stone tablet isn’t just testing my perception but also my martial arts will.”

This will was obviously left behind by the person who had carved this totem stone tablet. If such an extreme character were to leave behind their will, it could last for several hundred thousands of years up to even millions of years.

“If I can withstand this baptism of will, it’ll greatly benefit the growth of my battle spirit. This is a good opportunity!”

Lin Ming was thrilled. When he travelled down the Road of the Emperor, the strongest baptism of will he had withstood was the will of the Demon Emperor. Compared to a Patriarch of the ancient Phoenix Clan, the Demon Emperor was far from being equal.

If he could withstand the suppression of a powerhouse’s will, that would help him further exploring the potential of his battle spirit.

For those that cultivated martial arts, the potential of a battle spirit was determined by a variety of factors. Once it was formed, it would be difficult to increase it. There were very few heavenly materials that existed with the ability to enhance a battle spirit, and they could only be found through a stroke of destiny. For instance, the Twinlife Thunder Crystal.

The Twinlife Thunder Crystal was a divine stone that was bred along with a Thunder Source. However, a Thunder Source required hundreds of millions, sometimes even billions of years to be born. This made a Twinlife Thunder Crystal rare to the point that it was maddening. Only a great Holy Land of the Divine Realms would be able to obtain something so precious.

It was extremely difficult to enhance a battle spirit’s potential. When a battle spirit’s potential was already set, wanting to dig out every last bit of its potential wasn’t easy either. But using the will pressure of a top martial artist’s will was an outstanding method to temper and explore the potential of a battle spirit.

Hu!

The totem stone tablet’s martial arts will swept up like a storm, violently rushing towards Lin Ming’s spiritual sea. Within Lin Ming’s spiritual sea, the spear-shaped battle spirit floating in the air was forced to directly bear a baptism of this pressure.

Lin Ming’s entire body was covered in this pressure. He felt as if he was taking a pleasant swim in a sea of energy, comfortable and relaxing.

The artifact spirit’s eyes brightened. It looked at Lin Ming with some surprise, “From this boy’s last attacks, I felt that his will and battle spirit were extremely formidable. For the third test, I made him withstand a will that far surpassed his current skeletal age. I didn’t think he would be able to withstand it so easily…”

“That gray battle spirit is indeed special. Because of that layer of misty gray light, I didn’t notice the grade of the battle spirit from the beginning. I thought that it just reached silver, but now it seems to be at the peak of silver large success, just a step away from reaching silver perfection!”

“A fifth stage Life Destruction boy has a battle spirit at the peak of silver large success, that is incredible! Although the geniuses of the Divine Realm are like crouching tigers and hidden dragons, this is still the first time that I’ve heard someone managing to have their battle spirit reach the peak of silver large success at the fifth stage of Life Destruction! His battle spirit also has a special attribute to it, making its might far exceed an ordinary perfect silver battle spirit. If he can reach a gold level battle spirit in the future, allowing his battle spirit to directly influence reality, his combat strength will greatly increase.”

Many thoughts began rapidly cutting through the artifact spirit’s mind. It looked forward to Lin Ming’s growth more and more.

“Hey, this brat seems to be enjoying himself a bit too much. How can I let you relax in a test of my Saint Artifact Pavilion and easily pass? If I do that, I won’t have any face left at all.”

The Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit was itself equal to a Divine Lord realm master. Moreover, it had been in charge of Saint Artifact Pavilion for so many years and was an ancient existence of Phoenix Cry Palace, it was naturally proud and arrogant in its own right. But this arrogance was also awoken by Lin Ming’s actions.

“I want to see just how long you can manage to support yourself!”

The artifact spirit maliciously smiled. The will pressure on Lin Ming rapidly increased.

From using the level of a 35 year skeletal age at the start, it rapidly increased to 50 years, 70 years, and then 80 years!

The will pressure rapidly increased. Moreover, the totem stone tablet left behind by the Ancient Phoenix Clan Patriach contained not only his will but also the aura of the Great Dao’s Fire Laws together with the comprehension of Fire Laws belonging to an ancient Supreme Elder.

“So strong!”

The hazy mist around the spear-shaped battle spirit was forced down by the pressure; it was pushed down and squeezed together, less than an inch left between it and the battle spirit.

Lin Ming could feel the pressure, an incomparably daunting pressure. Even he was finding it difficult to withstand.

A black energy surged into Lin Ming’s spiritual sea as if it would tear everything apart!

“Is the third test round absurdly difficult, or is it purposely aimed at me to squeeze out my potential?”

Lin Ming had 120% confidence in his own martial arts will. While his other aspects might not be considered at the peak, he believed that in terms of will, it was difficult to find another genius in the Divine Realm that could stand side-by-side with him. But now, he actually felt pressured to his limits. If even he was being pressured this much, were there really any other disciples of the Ancient Phoenix Clan that could pass such a ridiculous test?

Within Lin Ming’s spiritual sea, the mist that usually floated around the spear-shaped battle spirit was actually forced onto that spear by the immense pressure.

“Let’s see just how long you can last!” The artifact spirit’s arrogant heart was roused by Lin Ming. In truth, it had long since determined that Lin Ming had successfully passed the test. It only wished to test Lin Ming’s limit and have him reach the breaking point.

“100 year skeletal age!”

The artifact spirit lightly shouted and no longer suppressed the will and aura of the totem stone tablet, instead allowing it to wantonly surge outwards. This totem stone tablet was left behind by the 26th acting Patriarch of the Ancient Phoenix Clan, Xiao Daoji. This totem stone tablet was originally part of a set. Xiao Daoji created seven sets of seven for a total of 49 stone tablets. The only reason this stone tablet was stored within Saint Artifact Pavilion was because it acted as the eye of the great formation and stabilized the 9999 saint artifacts that composed it.

Even when the past Xiao Daoji was placed between all the Patriarchs of the Ancient Phoenix Clan, he was still a stunningly amazing character. He had wanted to refine nine sets of nine for a total of 81 stone tablets, but unfortunately only managed to create 49 before he suffered a great calamity and perished.

Each of the 49 stone tablets contained a wisp of Xiao Daoji’s will and thoughts. Although this was only a tiny insignificant amount when compared to Xiao Daoji himself, it was still not something that an ordinary disciple could hope to contend with.

The limit of entering Saint Artifact Pavilion was a 100 year skeletal age. At this step, the entirety of Xiao Daoji’s thoughts were recklessly unleashed onto Lin Ming. And within Lin Ming’s spiritual sea, the mist floating around the spear-shaped battle was compressed to such a terrifying degree that it condensed onto the spear shaft itself.

Ka ka ka!

At this moment, a small crack appeared within the spear-shaped battle spirit.

“Mm!?”

The artifact spirit was startled. Without any time to respond, an indescribable aura gushed forth, surging out from the cracks on the surface of the battle spirit. This aura was a vast, endless, vigorous, deep, and unfathomable aura that left the artifact spirit stunned.

Lin Ming’s strength was clearly nothing compared to the artifact spirit itself, but this aura actually caused the artifact spirit to feel a deep sense of dread. This awe and trepidation seemed engraved into the very essence of its being, as if it were something passed down from time immemorial.

“Grandmist energy?”

The artifact spirit was dumbstruck. In the legends, the Divine Realm had a grandmist spirit artifact, formed at the very beginning of the world. This was the Heavenly Dao Relic formed within grandmist, and its age was as ancient as the universe itself!

That was an existence surpassing a spirit artifact, and grandmist energy was also a sign of a Heavenly Dao Relic. According to rumors, a Heavenly Dao Relic could not be formed, even by an Empyrean. But without a doubt, if a normal spirit artifact was able to absorb a sliver of grandmist energy, it’d be greatly beneficial to it!

Grandmist energy was something that could cause all spirit artifacts to feel awe and a maddening sense of desire.

“This youth actually has grandmist energy!?” The Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit was spooked; if true, this was a serious matter. It released a part of its divine sense to envelop Lin Ming’s body, but a moment later it shook its head. This wasn’t grandmist energy but rather contained an aura similar in nature to grandmist energy. It could just barely be called the elementary form of grandmist energy.

“It was indeed impossible for something like this to happen.” The artifact spirit sighed. Grandmist energy existed when the universe formed, but ever since it divided into yin and yang and then differentiated into the five elements, it vanished from existence. Even if some still existed in certain mystic realms throughout the universe, it still wasn’t something that Lin Ming could possibly refine. Just a wisp of grandmist energy was able to crush a star. Let alone Lin Ming, even a Divine Lord did not have the ability to do so!

“But although this youth only has an elementary form of grandmist energy, that is still very rare. I have no idea what he trains in, but in the future, if he can become a Holy Lord, World King, or even an Empyrean, there really might be a chance that he can evolve grandmist energy in his own world!”

As the artifact spirit was thinking, it suddenly saw Lin Ming’s spear-shaped battle spirit erupt with a dazzling light. In the next moment, the battle spirit was reborn. Although the main form was still silver gray as before, it clearly reflected a light trace of gold.

“Perfect silver battle spirit!”

The artifact spirit’s eyes lit up. This state was close to the level of a gold battle spirit. It never thought that by testing Lin Ming’s will, it would actually cause him to have a breakthrough in the boundary of his battle spirit!

“His battle spirit contains a grandmist aura and it has also reached silver perfection, just a step from becoming a gold battle spirit. This is truly extraordinary; this youth’s potential has no limits!”

“But compared to his will, his perception is quite ordinary. He hasn’t managed to comprehend much from the fragment of the Great Dao Laws within the totem stone tablet. This might be because I urged the energy within the stone tablet too much and it surpassed the limits of his skeletal age.”

“This is also normal. There’s no talent that excels in all aspects and can reach the limit in every field. This in itself is already beyond all expectations; he has perfectly passed this test. It is still incredible. I find it hard to believe that he is a martial artist that ascended from the lower realms. I wonder just how many lucky chances he encountered and how many adventures he experienced!”

As the artifact spirit had such thoughts run through his head, its eyes suddenly paused and the thoughts came to a screeching halt. It looked at Lin Ming, completely dumbfounded!

Just now the artifact spirit wanted to end the test. But when it tried to reclaim the aura of the stone tablet, it discovered that when it pulled back the aura, a massive part of the Great Dao Laws fragments was absorbed into Lin Ming’s body. These fragments seemed to have disappeared without a trace!

“The Great Dao Laws fragments were actually swallowed up as if they were water being drunk by a whale?” The artifact spirit was unable to figure out just what was going on. It could not see that within Lin Ming’s body, the Heretical God Sprout was shining with a crimson light. The Great Dao fragment that Xiao Daoji left behind was related to the Fire Laws; it perfectly matched the attribute of the Heretical God Sprout!

Lin Ming felt a burning heat in his dantian. The Heretical God Sprout was wildly swallowing up the fragments of the Great Dao that Xiao Daoji left behind. These fragments all contained the comprehension that Xiao Daoji held toward the Great Dao of Fire. For Lin Ming to perceive them was certainly difficult, but for the Heretical God Sprout, there wasn’t any problem at all.

Every fragment was caught in a boiling flow of energy and pulled into the Heretical God Sprout. They formed runes upon the Heretical God Sprout.

The numerous fragments of the Great Dao Laws constantly inscribed new symbols onto the Heretical God Sprout. The symbols slowly creeped together, gathering until a new bud slowly popped up from the crown of the Heretical God Sprout. It slowly grew larger until a young and tender leaf unfurled.

At this point, the Heretical God sprout had five leaves. Three thunder-attribute leaves and two fire-attribute leaves. Every one of them had their own special characteristics. The color and shapes were all completely different from one another.

The first flame leaf was shaped like a crimson heart of fire.

The second thunder leaf was long and narrow, keen like a golden sword.

The third leaf was also a thunder leaf. This leaf was purple and was strangely shaped like a small three-legged furnace, a small lion engraved into it. This was the Purple Lion Thunder Source that was swallowed into the Heretical God Sprout.

The fourth leaf was a thunder leaf. It was formed when Lin Ming ascended to the Divine Realm and absorbed the power of heavenly retribution. This leaf was golden red and shaped like a heavy sword.

The newest, fifth leaf was also very strange in appearance. It was square just like a jade seal stamp. The leaf was also a golden red, and the veins within the leaf formed strange textures, all of them reflecting the Great Dao Fire Laws that Xiao Daoji had comprehended.

In just 10 short breaths of time, Lin Ming managed to absorb half of the Great Dao Laws fragments!

In truth, these fragments were the core seeds of the Laws Xiao Daoji had left behind. They merged with the stone tablet and slowly evolved over time. Of those that were swallowed, it was possible for them to regenerate over time. But after having accumulated these fragments for so many years and now for half of them to be suddenly absorbed by Lin Ming, the artifact spirit felt an unusually rending pain. Moreover, it had no idea what had happened. These Great Dao Laws fragments were extremely esoteric. If one wanted to refine one, they would have to spend a great deal of time. How had this boy managed to absorb so many of them and to do it so easily?

“This brat certainly has some secrets on him. It’s impossible to achieve this level with just perception.” The artifact spirit had an extraordinary level of experience. Even though it couldn’t see the existence of the Heretical God Sprout, it could speculate based on the given information.

“This young man has the life of an Emperor. His potential and talent are both phenomenal. Most geniuses in Phoenix Cry Palace are in a mess when they finish my tests, but this boy not only passed them perfectly, he even obtained a great advantage. This sort of person, once their momentum reaches the limit, has the ability to turn the tables in all situations. A calamity that would annihilate a normal genius would be turned into an opportunity by this youth. This is the so-called destiny of an Emperor! It isn’t that their luck is good, but they have the strength to change dangers into lucky chances and also a confidence etched into their bones that allows them to do so!”

The artifact spirit sighed. A massive face appeared in the world once more. As for that stone tablet, it sunk back into the ground with a rumbling sound.

“Thank you, senior!” Lin Ming was overjoyed.

“I am only doing my duty as written in the rules. Young man, your harvests can be considered great this time. Not only did you obtain the power of Laws left behind by the last Palace Master, you also absorbed half of the Great Dao Fire Laws fragments that have accumulated for the last 20,000 years. Hehehaha!” The artifact spirit’s face twitched as it spoke to here, obviously pained by what had just happened.

“I thank senior for taking care of me.” Lin Ming smirked.

“Humph, what a flowery mouth, your words are quite nice!” The artifact spirit mocked. “I don’t know what method you used to absorb the Great Dao Laws fragments, but it must’ve been some trick of yours. Let me tell you, only the things you comprehend yourself are the most stable and solid. You must try to enhance your perception as much as possible. The further down you travel on the road of martial arts, the more and more important your perception will become. But you dual cultivate body and essence and the Gate of Opening within the Eight Inner Hidden Gates helps in developing the brain. It will allow you to enhance your perception. To you, that will be the most useful of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates.”

“I thank senior for the guidance.” Lin Ming respectfully said. Once one reached the end of the Divine Lord realm, the Eight Inner Hidden Gates would become less and less useful. At that time, he would have to step into the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace to display the best results. However, perception was different. Perception would always be useful.

“Mm, the Phoenix Blood Spear is yours. I look forward to seeing your growth!” The artifact spirit’s voice echoed between heaven and earth. There were three rounds in this test and it had lasted for an hour. However, only two incense sticks of time had passed outside.

Fifteen minutes was three incense sticks of time. When Huang Yuegong entered into the world of the Sunpierce Sword to take the test, he only managed to last for fifteen minutes.

Now, as Huang Yuegong saw Lin Ming reach two incense sticks of time, his complexion inevitably became ugly.

Although he knew that it was impossible for Lin Ming to succeed in his heart, for Lin Ming to last for two incense sticks of time proved that the brat’s talent was nearly equal to his own!

How could Huang Yuegong be comfortable with this? He became especially gloomy after listening to Jun Yunrue and the other female disciples continuously praise Lin Ming.

“Two incense sticks of time have passed, this is unbelievable. Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is too fierce!” Lin Junzhi praised as she looked at the hourglass, not noticing how grim Huang Yuegong had become.

“This defies the heavens! Two incense sticks of time, that is a level not even the Divine Transformation realm seniors of Phoenix Hall can reach!” A disciple surnamed Zhang praised. But he had a strange, unpleasant feeling in his heart.

Huang Yuegong was a haughty and powerful figure who was the young master of a great clan. As for him, he was only a commoner in the Divine Realm; his background was far surpassed by everyone else. He did not envy the differences in their starting points because the difference was just too great.

But as for Lin Ming, Lin Ming was only a martial artist from the mortal realms, a similar background to his own. But now that Lin Ming managed to accomplish something that this disciple surnamed Zhang never could, he certainly felt envy in his heart.

“The disciples of Phoenix Hall are strong, but that is only in strength; their talent and potential might not be any higher. Junior-apprentice Brother Lin really surpasses all expectations. Honorable Master’s judgment was indeed not wrong.” Jun Yunrue happily said. She was thrilled that Fairy Feng had found another powerful supporter.

Jun Yunrue’s words were like salt that scattered over Huang Yuegong’s wounds.

Huang Yuegong nearly gnashed his teeth. He said, “Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is indeed talented. But two incense sticks of time should be his limit!”

Huang Yuegong maintained the appearance of a magnanimous gentleman even though he crushed the fan in his hands. If this fan weren’t a low-grade saint artifact, it would have already shattered under the pressure.

“Damn it all, how could this happen!?” Huang Yuegong couldn’t accept what was happening. He was a chosen pride of the heavens, a genius even within the Huang Family Clan, one of the three great family clans of the Ancient Phoenix Clan. With his background, he should’ve blossomed into glory in Phoenix Cry Palace. He should be forcing all the countless heroic young elites here underneath him as he slowly climbed up to his position as the top master of Phoenix Cry Palace.

But now, he casually encountered this little commoner, a little martial artist that had ascended from the lower realms and was merely Jun Yunrue’s attendant, and this person that he would normally ignore as nothing more than an ant had actually managed to surpass him in talent! He would only need to last for another incense stick of time to reach his level.

If Lin Ming really managed to last for another incense stick of time and obtain the same result, then where would he have the face to hold his head high? If Lin Ming obtained the same result, that was simply an insult!

“Sir Huang, perhaps the boy fainted in the test.” One of Huang Yuegong’s lackeys said.

“That’s right. I think the most likely scenario is that he couldn’t withstand the terrifying test of a top grade saint artifact, and this caused his spiritual sea to be damaged and for him to faint. There’s no other way this is possible!” Song Baifeng echoed.

However, none of their words were able to alleviate Huang Yuegong’s gloomy complexion. His eyes shone as he stared at the scorching bright sun in the sky. He noticed something and he let out a long sigh of relief. His complexion relaxed and returned to normal as he said, “Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is about to exit.”

As he spoke, the blazing bright Phoenix Blood Spear sun in the sky violently rocked about.

As the two lackeys behind Huang Yuegong saw this, they all let out deep breaths. They praised, “Young master’s eyesight is amazing. Young master said that two incense sticks of time would be Lin Ming’s limit, and now it seems to be true. Two incense sticks and several more breaths of time, young master’s predictions really hit the mark!”

“That’s right, it’s like the words of a prophet” Song Baifeng followed up with more flattery.

As Huang Yuegong heard these words and saw what he expected would happen, he finally restored his calm. He opened his fan and swung it several times. This was his iconic action. Only when he was in a good mood would he wave his fan and play the gentleman.

“This Lin Ming is truly spectacular. He managed to last just a bit more than two-thirds of my time. But this top grade saint artifact test becomes more difficult the further on it goes, especially when nearing the fifteen minutes mark, it is at least 10 times more difficult than before!” Huang Yuegong said. Intentionally or unintentionally, what he said was the truth. The test became more and more difficult the further it progressed, and there was no exaggeration in his words.

His words meant that Lin Ming was still a lot worse than he was. Huang Yuegong was able to accept this.

“That’s right, a little martial artist who ascended from the lower realms is no different from a beggar to us. How could he possibly compare to the dignity and majesty of Sir Huang? Although he managed to last a bit shorter than Sir Huang, because the test rapidly climbs in difficulty near the end, the difference is still like the clouds and mud!”

The lackeys flattered again and again. This caused Jun Yunrue to slightly frown.

At this time, Lin Ming was ejected from the scorching bright sun. He didn’t look awkward and messed up like Huang Yuegong had been. Instead, he gently landed on the ground. Besides his face being flushed a bit red, there was nothing else out of place.

“Mm? How come the boy isn’t injured?”

Huang Yuegong’s eyebrows twisted together. He badly wanted to see Lin Ming vomiting up blood after being grievously wounded.

“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, are you alright?” Jun Yunrue quickly ran up to him. She probed him for a moment and was relieved to find that there wasn’t any serious damage.

“I’m fine, senior-apprentice sister.” Lin Ming casually replied, his eyes still looking up at the blazing sun in the sky.

Chapter 965 – Blinding Spear Light

…

…

…

Huang Yuegong smiled as he watched Lin Ming stare at the Phoenix Blood Spear. He leisurely swung his fan and thoughtfully said, “There’s no need to keep looking. That top grade saint artifact isn’t easy to obtain. You can only look but you can’t touch.”

“Hehe, boy, continuing to look is useless. One of them will be our young master’s sooner or later. However, a brat like you should already be proud to have even a tiny fraction of our young master’s talent.” A lackey spouted with a pompous tone.

Lin Ming ignored him and continued to look at the sky.

The lackey saw that he was being ignored and angrily said, “You little shit, I am speaking to you! Are you deaf!?”

There were some people with a strong sense of slave mentality and self-esteem. They would happily wag their tails in front of their masters, but they actually wouldn’t endure the insults of commoners. This was because they normally groveled and were insulted in front of others too much. They had traded in whatever shred of dignity they had left for status and power. If they couldn’t even keep their swagger in front of commoners, they would certainly be angry!

“Motherfucker you are courting death.” The lackey had an impulse to fight. In his opinion, Lin Ming only had a fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation. He definitely wouldn’t be a match for a Divine Sea powerhouse.

Just as he was about to make his move, the blazing sun in the sky radiated with an even brighter light than before, as if it would explode at any moment. It instantly eased down with the light rapidly retracting in on itself, turning into a three foot thick beam of light that fell downward!

In this beam of light was a dim shadow that spun around. It was a long spear!

“This…”

Huang Yuegong’s eyes widened. The two lackeys behind him, as well as Song Baifeng, JunYunrue, and the others, were all dumbstruck.

“That spear, is that the Phoenix Blood Spear!?”

“The Phoenix Blood Spear is coming down? How is that possible?”

As the red saint rank spear flew toward Lin Ming, the unbelievable result had become an undeniable truth!

Lin Ming had obtained the Phoenix Blood Spear!

Huang Yuegong’s fan fell on the ground with a plop. The faces of the two lackeys behind him, as well as Song Baifeng’s, were twisted in a complex puzzle. Even that sensible and na?ve Lin Junzhi wasn’t any different. She rubbed her eyes as if she was seeing things.

This was a top grade saint artifact! A top grade saint artifact that contained terrifying power!

As the saint spear neared, it began to emit thrumming sounds. From the start, there wasn’t any sound. But as it appeared, it became increasingly loud, increasingly resonant, as if a True Dragon that was caged for a long time was emerging from its deep slumber. As excited whistling sounds filled the air, within the rich energy of Saint Artifact Pavilion, a potent infernal energy was stirred up by the Phoenix Blood Spear. The energy formed weak red ripples in the air that revolved around the Phoenix Blood Spear like a hundred flaming birds.

To have the surrounding energy submit in worship of its own volition, and to be able to command the infernal energy and origin energy around it, this spear managed to achieve such phenomenons.

Wuwuwu – !

The Phoenix Blood Spear issued out a clear cry as Lin Ming firmly grasped it in his palm. Although the spear hadn’t reached the level of forming its own artifact spirit, it still seemed to have a life of its own. This was truly a weapon worthy of being called a peak existence amongst all top grade saint artifacts.

With a top grade saint artifact in hand, a Divine Sea powerhouse’s strength would greatly increase. An early Divine Sea martial artist could use this to defeat a late Divine Sea martial artist!

Moreover, this was a peak top grade saint artifact!

In truth, even a high-grade saint artifact was enough to cause most disciples of Phoenix Hall to go mad with envy. Even though Huang Yuegong had such a prestigious background, he still only had three high-grade saint artifacts.

Lin Ming grasped the nine foot nine inch Phoenix Blood Spear and thrust it toward the vast skies. At this moment his figure was tall and straight. His handsome appearance, the ethereal temperament that was untainted by the world, the faint frosty bloodthirsty underneath, and the Phoenix Blood Spear that overflowed with killing intent; all of these factors complemented each other, making it seem as if a high principle of the Heavenly Dao was contained within him!

This sight caused an inexplicable feeling to surge in the hearts of Jun Yunrue and the other women present. Lin Ming actually managed to take a peak top grade saint artifact!

“How is this possible…”

Huang Yuegong looked at Lin Ming in a daze. He had estimated Lin Ming’s limit would be two incense sticks of time, and Lin Ming had indeed lasted for two incense sticks of time before he left the test. However, the truth was that it wasn’t that he only lasted for two incense sticks of time, but that it only took him two incense sticks of time to obtain the recognition of Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit!

As he recalled how he was filled with such confidence in his predictions, the charitable disdain he had shown when he obtained a high-grade saint artifact, and even the moment he said he would help guide Lin Ming, Huang Yuegong felt as if he were nothing more than a clown!

“This fellow, is the Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit blind? How can he possibly surpass me? He is only someone from the lower realms, someone with a background no different from a beggar! But me, I am a direct descendant from one of the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s three great family clans, the Huang Family Clan! In the entire Phoenix Cry Palace, my talent should be at the peak! But now, I’m completely surpassed by him!”

Huang Yuegong’s face twitched. This was the most disgraceful event in his entire life. Compared to a martial artist from the lower realms, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the difference was like a prince and a beggar. But now, that prince was defeated by the beggar!

As for Song Baifeng, he began to feel some fear. How could his luck be so bad. He had casually extorted someone this time but somehow managed to offend a monstrous genius, Lin Ming. If this fellow were to rise up in fame and glory in the future, wouldn’t that mean that his life was over?

His thoughts raced. Just as he was thinking about how to remedy the situation, another startling scene caused his jaw to nearly drop to the ground.

He saw that in the sky, the scorching sun that represented the Phoenix Blood Spear slowly disappeared. But at the same time, at an even higher space, a bright red spot of light formed, condensing into a seed that slowly fell down toward Lin Ming’s Phoenix Blood Spear.

“That is, that is the source power left behind in Saint Artifact Pavilion by the old Palace master, it contains the old Palace Master’s comprehension of Laws and is supposed to be a reward only bestowed upon the most extraordinarily talented of disciples!” Song Baifeng blurted out, his expression as if he had seen a ghost. He guarded Saint Artifact Pavilion for many years and had a very good understanding of the place. He never thought that when Lin Ming obtained the Phoenix Blood Spear, he would also obtain the approval of Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit to such an extent that it would actually gift him a wisp of the old Palace Master’s source power!”

The Phoenix Blood Spear was originally a peak top grade spirit weapon. This wisp of source power also contained a blood mark of the old Palace Master; that was incomparably pure blood of the Ancient Phoenix. If that were to be absorbed into the Phoenix Blood Spear, the Phoenix Blood Spear would come infinitely close to being a transcendent saint artifact!

If a few more heavenly materials and sacrifices were refined into the spear, there truly would be a chance that it would transform into a transcendent saint artifact. After becoming a transcendent saint artifact, with the Phoenix Blood Spear’s origins, it would be very easy to form an artifact spirit. A transcendent saint artifact with an artifact spirit was a spirit artifact!

A spirit artifact – that was an existence he could simply not imagine!

He could already foresee the terrifying potential Lin Ming would unveil in the future. By offending such a person, he would never again have another restful night of sleep!

Chapter 966 – Talent and Treasure That Arouse Envy

…

…

…

The moment that the source strength left behind by the old Palace Master fused into the Phoenix Blood Spear, Lin Ming felt an intense familiarity, as if this spear became part of his flesh and blood.

He obtained the approval of Saint Artifact Pavilion and now the Phoenix Blood Spear also recognized him as its master, connecting to him through heart and soul.

“What a strong source strength! There’s even such pure blood of the Ancient Phoenix. I wonder just what boundary the old Palace Master was. Although he cannot be compared to the Patriarch of the Ancient Phoenix Clan, he should still be a heaven-shaking existence, someone with a cultivation even above Senior Fairy Feng. Since he is someone that can forge a spirit artifact, it is my good fortune to be able to obtain a wisp of his source strength.” Lin Ming said to himself.

The stone tablet that stabilized the eye of the great array formation within Saint Artifact Pavilion was left behind by an old Patriarch of the Ancient Phoenix Clan. But the source strength that was absorbed into the Phoenix Blood Spear was left behind by the old Palace Master.

While a Palace Master was certainly inferior to a Patriarch, source strength was something consumable, whereas a stone tablet could continue existing in perpetuity. After hundreds of millions of years, the number of stone tablets accumulated would be terrifying. But as for source strength, every single drop used meant one drop less; it was an extremely rare and precious treasure.

The Ancient Phoenix Clean had a population of countless hundreds of billions. Nearly all these people cultivated martial arts. From a common mortal to becoming an outer disciple of a palace, from an outer disciple to entering Firebird Hall and becoming an official disciple, and then even entering Golden Crow Hall, Vermillion Hall, and Phoenix Hall afterward, the competition was furious and vivid. With so many geniuses being raised every year, just how many of them were ever able to obtain a wisp of source strength left behind by a Palace Master?

Once Lin Ming really became a great character and no longer needed to rely on the Phoenix Blood Spear, he could absorb the wisp of source strength and use it to enhance his bloodline and refine the Laws within him, even enhancing his own cultivation. It was a treasure with many uses.

The source strength of the old Palace Master turned into a golden red line that spread over the Phoenix Blood Spear. This source strength would greatly enhance the might of the Phoenix Blood Spear. Although the spear hadn’t reached the level of a transcendent saint artifact, the source strength allowed it to come infinitely close!

The Phoenix Blood Spear’s light became increasingly radiant as if a sun fused into the shaft.

Nine feet nine inches, a numeral that existed at the pinnacle. The array formation within the Phoenix Blood Spear also contained a high principles of the Heavenly Dao; this spear was truly an incomparably beast amongst saint artifacts.

Beside Lin Ming, Jun Yunrue and the other disciples’ faces were full of envy. Lin Junzhi stared at the spear shaft in Lin Ming’s hands with watery eyes. She wanted to reach out with her hand and trace it.

As for Song Baifeng, he looked as if he had lost his soul. He had put on an act to flatter Huang Yuegong today, but in the process he had managed to offend Lin Ming. If Lin Ming didn’t die in the future and managed to rise to glory, wouldn’t stepping on a small shrimp like himself be as easy as turning a hand?

“Good spear.” Lin Ming casually swung the spear and an invisible wave shot out. The surrounding heaven and earth origin energy and infernal energy were stirred up by the Phoenix Blood Spear, forming a faint crescent moon shaped energy blade that shot outward.

Peng!

The energy blade struck Saint Artifact Pavilion’s spatial barrier where it vanished. Lin Ming hadn’t used any of his own strength just now; that was merely a damaging power formed from the Phoenix Blood Spear. This was the greatest difference between saint artifacts and ordinary treasures. A saint artifact contained an inherent array formation as well as the principles of the Great Dao. If a mortal were to obtain the recognition of a great high-grade saint artifact, they could use it to instantly kill a Xiantian realm martial artist. That crescent moon shaped energy blade was absolutely not something that a Xiantian, or even a Revolving Core, martial artist could block.

A scratch to wound, a touch to kill, that was the attribute of a divine weapon.

Close to Lin Ming, Huang Yuegong also paled. The fiercer the Phoenix Blood Spear was, the more unwilling he became!

On this day, if it were one of the top disciples of Phoenix Hall that obtained the Phoenix Blood Spear, he would at most feel envy in his heart but he would still compliment them outwardly. This was because the top disciples of Phoenix Hall had a background not any worse than his own. Even if they were a cow, there wouldn’t be anything to say if their talent was higher.

But now he was stepped on by Lin Ming and his face had been maliciously slapped. Huang Yuegong felt as if he would rather die than live.

“Young master, I think that Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit was confused. How could it possibly bestow the Phoenix Blood Spear onto Lin Ming and not give the Sunpierce Sword to young master? He is only a beggar that ascended from the lower realms, he simply doesn’t have the qualifications to wield the Phoenix Blood Spear.”

“That’s right, the Phoenix Blood Spear should belong to young master. Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit definitely made a mistake somewhere.”

The two lackeys could see that their master was enraged and they quickly tried to soothe him with true essence sound transmissions. However, all their blabbering had no effect. It even further angered Huang Yuegong instead. “Shut the hell up! Are you saying that I am inferior to a beggar? Have I not lost enough face already!?”

Huang Yuegong’s true essence sound transmission contained a thick killing intent that immediately silenced his two lackeys.

“You are called Lin Ming?” Huang Yuegong suddenly looked at Lin Ming. “It seems I was wrong. Your potential was actually high enough to obtain the recognition of Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit. You’re very good!”

Huang Yuegong’s was gloomy. Although he was temporarily suppressing the rage in his heart and saying some pleasant banter, his tone actually contained an aggressive edge.

Lin Ming turned and looked at Huang Yuegong. With his tall and straight figure combined with the nine foot nine inch Phoenix Blood Spear, even though Huang Yuegong was trying to pressure him with his momentum, Lin Ming remained unmoved.

“What an impressive aura. For you to reach this point even though you ascended from the lower realms, that proves you’ve got quite the talent. You know, I’ve heard a little story in Phoenix Cry Palace that originated from the mortal worlds. Are you interested in hearing it?”

Although Huang Yuegong asked Lin Ming a question, he didn’t wait for him to reply before speaking. “There was once a beautiful little mortal girl who had an uncle that managed to cultivate to the Divine Sea realm. One day, he gifted her a beautiful vermillion bird feather dress. She put on this feather dress every day when she went to her martial house to train, and she enjoyed the looks of envy that she received from everyone there. But one day, her vermillion bird feather dress disappeared. She eventually found it. It had been shredded apart by someone and thrown in the gutter, utterly ruined and filthy. The little girl cried over and over again, miserably and pitifully, her heart broken. She simply wasn’t able to bear it. Afterwards, her uncle gifted her yet another, more beautiful vermillion bird feather dress. She put it on to show off at the martial house, and as a result, the little girl disappeared. When they finally found her, her primal yin energy had been snatched away and the fires of her life had diminished to the point of fading away at any moment. She had become utterly mad…”

Huang Yuegong’s voice turned colder and crueler as he spoke. The meaning behind his little story was obvious to all. Jun Yunrue stiffened as she heard this and she felt her heart go cold. But Lin Ming maintained his calm, as if he simply didn’t understand the meaning of the story. He looked at Huang Yuegong and faintly smiled, “What are you trying to say?”

“I am only informing you that whether it is Golden Crow Hall, Vermillion Bird Hall, Phoenix Hall, the entire Phoenix Cry Palace, or even the Ancient Phoenix Clan itself, the struggles of the various factions are far from what the likes of you can imagine. Sometimes, not only will talent not bring you supreme honor and glory, but it will instead draw a fatal calamity upon your head!”

“Huang Yuegong, what nonsense are you spouting!? Do you think that my Phoenix Cry Palace has no rules? If you murder a talented disciple, you will be personally executed by the Palace Master!” Jun Yunrue became incensed as she saw Huang Yuegong threaten someone on her side.

“Palace Master? Hehe, who is the Palace Master? Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, you haven’t been here long enough so you have no idea how high and lofty the status of Palace Master is! Do you really think that Lin Ming has the qualifications to be personally raised by the Palace Master? You think that just because he obtained the approval of Saint Artifact Pavilion and the source strength of the old Palace Master that he has the qualifications? Let me tell you something, the source strength left behind by the old Palace Master can last for tens of thousands of years and be given to dozens if not hundreds of disciples. And out of all these disciples, just how many can become the Palace Master? Let alone the Palace Master, even becoming a Vice Palace Master is a near insurmountable moat! Which palace has several hundred Vice Palace Masters?”

“Phoenix Cry Palace has countless talents. Even if you’re the chief disciple of Phoenix Hall, the most you will obtain is the Palace Master’s notice. Take my Phoenix Cry Palace for example. There is at least one Phoenix Hall chief disciple every 100 years, and sometimes even several of them! But a Palace Master only comes once every several tens of thousands of years! How can you even compare?”

“Moreover, Lin Ming isn’t even the chief disciple of Phoenix Hall; he falls far short! Do you think that Phoenix Hall’s chief disciple doesn’t have their own top grade saint artifact? Especially Senior-apprentice Brother White Daohong, his origin is deep and people even say he has spiritual powers. I believe that at his level, he doesn’t even need to come to Saint Artifact Pavilion!”

Lin Ming maintained his calm demeanor throughout Huang Yuegong’s tirade. He said, “Huang Yuegong, if you have any words to say, then speak them out, loud and clear. Stop beating around the bush.”

“Heh, Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is indeed a smart man. I will tell you that in a situation where you have no foundation, the more you show off your talents the more dangerous it will be for you. Although you don’t have the qualifications to be noticed by the Palace Master, do you think that Senior Xiao Jiuyang will ignore you? Don’t you remember just what sort of a relationship Senior Xiao Jiuyang has with Fairy Feng!?”

“Without an influence to support you, those with talent might die even faster! The Divine Realm is a world of factions, and the Ancient Phoenix Clan is not a single monolith. In a situation where there is no war against some foreign enemy, the struggles on the inside are far more violent and fierce than the fights on the outside! Do you think that all talents will be vigorously raised? If you do, then you’re wrong. Of everyone within the Ancient Phoenix Clan, their first and foremost consideration is their own benefit, then the benefit of their family clan, and only then the benefit of the Ancient Phoenix Clan.”

Huang Yuegong’s words were not lies. The Ancient Phoenix Clan was simply far too large with a population of several hundred billion people. It was equivalent to a superpower in the mortal world. All the citizens of this superpower might not consider their country’s interests first, but would think of their own benefit and their family clan’s benefit.

“Senior-apprentice Brother Huang Yuegong, are you trying to say that you are planning to be my backer?” Lin Ming’s lips curved up in a droll smile.

“Haha, speaking with a smart man like you is indeed refreshing. Yes, my Huang Family Clan is one of the three great family clans of the Ancient Phoenix Clan. It is one of the strongest influences within the Ancient Phoenix Clan. If you join us, you will be able to find asylum and endless resources to enjoy!”

“Oh, is there something so good? Is Senior-apprentice Brother so kind that you would help me without reason?”

“Hehe, Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is clever. If that’s the case, I won’t mince words any longer. I’ll be frank with you, I want to buy your Phoenix Blood Spear! The price I pay will not have you suffer a loss. In truth, me taking the Phoenix Blood Spear off your hands is actually helping you. There is a saying that a man’s own wealth will be his ruin if he arouses the greed of others. You simply cannot protect the Phoenix Blood Spear, and moreover, with your fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation, you cannot display the full might of the Phoenix Blood Spear. But I am different. If I have the Phoenix Blood Spear, my combat strength will dramatically rise. At that time, I and the Huang Family Clan behind me will shelter you within Phoenix Cry Palace!”

Chapter 967 – Ready to Fight

…

…

…

“Junior-brother Lin, don’t listen to him!” Jun Yunrue was afraid as she saw Lin Ming appear as if he were listening; she thought he might think of switching sides to being one of Huang Yuegong’s subordinates and thus be on Xiao Jiuyang’s side. She quickly said, “You cannot believe Huang Yuegong’s words; he is lying to you!”

“Hey, Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, you can eat anything you want but that doesn’t mean you can speak however you want. How are my words lies? Of the three great family clans, no matter which one, all of them have countless members from the outside. If we want to develop we certainly can’t rely on just our own members. If Junior-apprentice Brother wishes, I can immediately bring him to see an Elder of my Huang Family Clan.” Huang Yuegong’s voice was cold. Although he wanted to obtain Jun Yunrue as a toy and helper, compared to a top grade saint artifact she was nothing at all.

“Huang Yuegong! Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is my Honorable Master Fairy Feng’s person. With Honorable Master, who would dare to move against her!”

“Fairy Feng? How hilarious!” Huang Yuegong shook his head, snickering.

“If there was not Fairy Feng, Lin Ming might have some safety. But because of her, Lin Ming is now the enemy of the world! Who is Fairy Feng? Some slut of common origin! You think that she can reach the level of Sage Jiuyang? Open your eyes and take a good look! Of the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s 72 palaces, just which Palace Master comes from a common mortal background!? Of those Palace Masters, even if they aren’t from the three great family clans, they are still from famous great families. For instance, Senior-apprentice Brother White Daohong is from the White Family Clan. If Fairy Feng wants to compete for the throne, heh, she is simply biting off more than she can chew. A hundred years from now when the Palace Master retires and Senior Sage Jiuyang takes the throne, do you think he’ll get rid of all opposition?”

Huang Yuegong devilishly grinned, not caring about how ruthless his words were. He did not fear offending Fairy Feng, because he knew that a hundred years from now, the one to become the new Palace Master would be Sage Jiuyang. Fairy Feng was simply unable to compare with him.

And now, Huang Yuegong had enough status in Phoenix Cry Palace that even Fairy Feng couldn’t do anything against him.

“Junior-apprentice Sister Jun, let me advise you that even birds know to choose good wood for their nests. If you are willing to follow me, I will assuredly favor you as my good little pet. Medium-grade saint artifacts, pills of all kinds, everything can be yours. In this world, people should be smart about the choices they make. Do you know that little story I told you? That story is not some folktale, but a true story. That little girl’s uncle tried investigating what happened to her afterward but finally gave up with nothing to show for. Do you know why? Because there will always be people in this world more ruthless than you!”

Huang Yuegong seemed to be happier the more he spoke. He was venting all the pent up gloominess from being slapped in the face by Lin Ming.

Lin Ming was patiently listening. In truth, he wasn’t just listening to Huang Yuegong’s nonsense for fun, but because he wanted to have a better understanding of the real situation in the Ancient Phoenix Clan so that he wouldn’t suffer a loss later because of his own lack of knowledge.

Through his own reasoning, Huang Yuegong was exaggerating matters, but not by much. The Ancient Phoenix Clan was indeed far too large. With 72 palaces and three great family clans divided all over the Divine Realm, in a situation where there wasn’t a foreign enemy they were forced to band together against, the cohesion and comradery throughout wasn’t too great. In the Ancient Phoenix Clan, even if one had talent, it was still possible to summon a calamity upon your head if there wasn’t protection!

“Huang Yuegong, you can dream on!” Jun Yunrue’s face was red with fury. If she had any favorable impressions of Huang Yuegong before, after listening to him refer to her as a pet and also wanting to have her join his harem, she was fuming.

“Humph, it seems you would rather do things the hard way! Jun Yunrue, you will regret everything one day, because the one that is destined to become the next Palace master is Senior Sage Jiuyang! When that time comes and you wish to seek refuge under me, I don’t know if I’ll even bother to see you! Humph!” After reaching this step, Huang Yuegong no longer bothered trying to maintain his image. This caused Jun Yunrue to huff with anger.

Huang Yuegong no longer bothered with Jun Yunrue. His eyes moved to Lin Ming and he said in a low voice, “Lin Ming, you best think about it carefully. I have a set of high-grade saint artifacts, a high-grade ring, high-grade vestment, high-grade spear, high-grade bracer, and high-grade pill furnace, all to trade for your Phoenix Blood Spear! You should know that the value of each of these five treasures is inferior to your Phoenix Blood Spear, but if combined they might not be any worse. Moreover, you can obtain the asylum of my Huang Family Clan, so what is there to lose?”

As Huang Yuegong finished, Lin Ming laughed, he laughed recklessly.

“What are you laughing about.” Huang Yuegong frowned.

“I’m laughing at how wonderfully calculated your plan is. Five high-grade saint artifacts to trade for my Phoenix Blood Spear? Although I might not understand saint artifacts too much, even I know that every grade will have a difference of at least ten times. This Phoenix Blood Spear in my hands is a peak top grade saint artifact, and it also has the source strength of the old Palace Master fused into it. What you just offered me might be only enough for a top high-grade saint artifact. If I wanted to trade in my Phoenix Blood Spear, I could trade in 200-300 of your kind of saint artifacts. And yet you want to use just five of them to trade for my Phoenix Blood Spear? Do you think I’m an idiot or something?”

As Lin Ming spoke, blue veins started to stick out from Huang Yuegong’s forehead. Huang Yuegong forcefully restrained the anger in his heart and coldly said, “When people are too greedy, sometimes they will die because of it!”

Lin Ming sneered. “How ridiculous. You want to trade for my several hundred high-grade saint artifact value Phoenix Blood Spear with only five? And I am greedy if I don’t? Is there such a truth in this world? Those two worms behind you keep on blabbering about how I have the background of a beggar, and indeed, compared to a chosen pride of heaven from the Divine Realm, I am truly a beggar. But the current question is, if I wanted to sell you the Phoenix Blood Spear as a beggar, can you afford this beggar’s spear even with your entire net worth?”

Lin Ming mercilessly mocked. His words were like a palm that slapped Huang Yuegong. Beside him, Jun Yunrue was excitedly applauding in her heard. She wanted to cry out ‘well said’. Such a counterattack really vented her anger!

Huang Yuegong’s face was red to the point of looking like a liver. He had always been wealthy, but against this top grade Phoenix Blood Spear, if he went according to its market price, then even if he sold everything he still wouldn’t be able to afford the spear head. He only had fve high-grade saint artifacts himself, so how could he not be angry?

Huang Yuegong was angry from shame, and from behind him, his two lackeys that were scolded as dogs by Lin Ming suddenly rushed forward!

“You brat, you are courting death!”

The two lackeys were like dogs whose tail had been stepped on. They wildly shouted. They were Divine Sea martial artists that were servants of a great family clan, so how could they allow a fifth stage Life Destruction martial artist from the lower realms to insult them?

The two lackeys took thick sabers from their spatial ring and chopped out at Lin Ming’s head. These two sabers were saint artifacts, and although they were the worst among the lowest grade of saint artifacts, a saint artifact was still a saint artifact. As the two sabers cut out, killing intent surged forth!

Lin Ming chuckled. “Sixth stage Life Destruction early Divine Sea realm? How laughable!”

These two lackeys’ strength was 108,000 miles from comparing with Yang Yun, let alone someone like Lin Ming. Especially since he acquired the Phoenix Blood Spear!

“Let me take a good look at the might of this divine spear!”

Lin Ming stepped forward and his spear thrust out. He did not use true essence nor did he open the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. All he used was his pure physical strength combined with the Phoenix Blood Spear to attack!

Hu-!

A sharp and resonant cry filled the air, as if a divine phoenix had awoken within the Phoenix Blood Spear. In the surrounding world, all of the origin energy was stirred up around the Phoenix Blood Spear without need for Lin Ming to do anything. With a thrust of his spear, the saber lights of the two lackeys were shredded to pieces.

A beam of light recklessly swallowed their bodies. The two lackeys miserable screamed out as their protective true essence exploded. Flesh and blood burst out from their chests. Fragments of ribs mixed with crushed meat rained down on the world!

The two cried out like pigs being slaughtered. They flew backwards and crashed into the ground, blood pooling around them.

In a single exchange, the two of them were sent to the point of life and death with a single strike from the Phoenix Blood Spear. This was not Lin Ming’s strength but the power inherent within the Phoenix Blood Spear. Lin Ming only released the spear’s power into the world.

Two Divine Sea martial artists were actually easily defeated by Lin Ming. Lin Junzhi and the other young disciples were shocked so much their mouths closed shut. Although someone who was willing to be a lackey was normally limited in talent and strength, they were still martial artists that relied on themselves to break into the Divine Sea. But in front of Lin Ming, they were no different from little children, unable to resist at all!

“This isn’t surprising at all! Junior-apprentice Brother Lin’s strength is stronger than what we imagined. We thought that he was only able to kill the weakest of Divine Sea powerhouses, but now it seems he is far better than that, especially now that he has obtained the top grade saint artifact, the Phoenix Blood Spear!”

Jun Yunrue flourished her long sword and stood by Lin Ming, vigilantly looking at Huang Yuegong. At this moment, Huang Yuegong’s anger reached the extreme. He was a volcano that was about to burst!

“Lin Ming, if you want to beat a dog you must look at their owner. You actually dare to attack my lackeys? Very well then!”

An incomparably sharp killing intent surged out from Huang Yuegong, causing the surrounding temperature to drop. A soft sword jumped into Huang Yuegong’s hand as if it had a mind of its own. This was Huang Yuegong’s favored sword, a peak high-grade saint artifact!

With sword in hand, Huang Yuegong’s aura changed. He was now similar to a resting ancient vicious beast. He hadn’t attacked yet, but once he did it would come crashing out like a bolt of thunder!

Lin Ming’s expression was dignified. Putting aside the disparity between their weapons, Huang Yuegong’s strength far surpassed his own.

Lin Ming’s current strength was equivalent to Yang Yun if he had managed to reach the middle Divine Sea realm. Yang Yun’s talent wasn’t too amazing. In terms of foundation, there was no way he could compare to the geniuses of the Divine Realm.

Moreover, Huang Yuegong had crossed nine stages of Life Destruction. As one of the more talented individuals of Phoenix Hall, how could he not be extraordinary?

Beside Lin Ming, Jun Yunrue and the others all felt as if this was their last stand. The pressure in facing Huang Yuegong was simply too great.

At this moment when all daggers were drawn, a strange fluctuation appeared in the skies. A massive face slowly appeared, and a vast and compelling voice rang through the world. “Saint Artifact Pavilion is the deposit of Phoenix Cry Palace’s great weapons. According to the palace’s rules, those who dare to fight here will be suppressed for 1000 years!”

This massive face was Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit. As it spoke, colossal energy was released from the sky, falling down on the entire world and instantly imprisoning an area of space.

Lin Ming, Huang Yuegong, Jun Yunrue, and everyone else were unable to move.

Chapter 968 – To Cause a Stir

…

…

…

Phoenix Cry Palace had their own strictly enforced sect rules. Although Phoenix Cry Palace, and even the entire Ancient Phoenix Clan, had their own struggles with intrigue and infighting occurring behind the scenes, the assassination and ruination of talented disciples, and even the murder of others to steal their treasures, had to be done in private; they could not be publicly shown. The reputation of the sect would otherwise suffer irreparable damage. On the surface, the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s rules could not be violated by anyone.

Saint Artifact Pavilion forbade private battles inside, and the disciples of Phoenix Cry Palace were absolutely forbidden from killing each other over treasures.

Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit was equal to a Divine Lord realm master. Although it didn’t have a physical form, it could still manipulate the various great arrays in Saint Artifact Pavilion. As it appeared this time, it immediately suppressed the energy within the disciples present.

“Huang Yuegong, the two lackeys behind you were the first to start a fight. According to the palace’s rules, they will be locked away for a thousand years! Do you have any objections?”

The artifact spirit icily said. As Huang Yuegong heard this, he almost turned and stormed away. His lackeys were only sixth stage Life Destruction Divine Sea martial artists. Amongst the common mortals of the Divine Realm, they could be considered decent. However, when placed against the standard of Phoenix Cry Palace, they weren’t even gifted enough to be a disciple. If this were ordinary times, he wouldn’t care about the fate of these lackeys. But now Lin Ming had injured them, and the artifact spirit wanted to imprison them; this was the same as slapping him in the face.

He came from a noble and distinguished family! Aside from the top disciples of Phoenix Hall, it was always him stepping on others, not others making him eat a loss.

But today, his face had been thoroughly ruined. He had been stepped on until he was covered in cuts and bruises!

“What about it? Do you refuse my judgment?” The artifact spirit indifferently said. Everything that it did was in line with the palace’s rules. Although Lin Ming had humiliated the two, they were the ones that mocked Lin Ming as a beggar first. The verdict handed down by the artifact spirit could not be questioned by anyone.

“I have no opinion!” Huang Yuegong grimaced. He wasn’t an idiot. He simply didn’t have the ability to resist an existence on the level of the Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit. In the face of such a powerful being, Huang Yuegong could only patiently bear the shame.

At this point, he actually calmed down. Before now, all the words he spoke were to obtain Lin Ming’s Phoenix Blood Spear. But now, he realized that he had been played by Lin Ming. Lin Ming never planned on selling him the Phoenix Blood Spear, and instead was playing along as if he were a monkey. How could Huang Yuegong not hate him?

As Huang Yuegong’s voice fell, an invisible energy surged out from the sky, covering the two lackeys that were lying face down on the ground like dead dogs. The two lackeys then disappeared.

A sixth stage Life Destruction Divine Sea martial artist would only have several thousand years of life. Imprisoning them for 1000 years was the same as writing off a good portion of their life.

Huang Yuegong coldly watched as his servants disappeared. His eyes, which had been brimming with a thick killing intent when he realized Lin Ming was playing with him, were now containing a stark indifference. But there was actually a deep hatred hidden within.

He deeply looked at Lin Ming as if he were scanning him down to the bone. Finally, he turned around and strode away.

This left Song Baifeng silently standing behind Lin Ming, covered in cold sweat. His job was to guard Saint Artifact Pavilion, and in other words that was to serve the Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit. Now that he saw that the artifact spirit had the intention of supporting Lin Ming, he became even more afraid. As he recalled the scene of him extorting Jun Yunrue and the others, he had the urge to commit suicide right here and now, in this hall. He wished that he could transform into a lump of poop so that Lin Ming would ignore him.

Luckily, Jun Yunrue and the others didn’t seem to care for him, and the artifact spirit also vanished from the skies.

“Lin Ming, what Huang Yuegong said is actually not wrong. Since you refused him today, that is the same as offending the entire Huang Family Clan. In addition, Xiao Jiuyang is part of the Xiao Family Clan. Of the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s two great family clans, you’ve managed to offend two.” Jun Yunrue quietly said.

Thinking about it, if she were in Lin Ming’s shoes today, she wouldn’t necessarily be able to withstand Huang Yuegong’s threats. Huang Yuegong was rampant and arrogant, but the words he said because he wanted to obtain the Phoenix Blood Spear were perfectly rational. Someone with a weaker will would’ve truly felt fear.

Lin Ming smiled, “Senior-apprentice Sister Jun worries for me too much. As for offending the Xiao Family Clan, that is something that will happen in the future. Xiao Jiuyang is vying for the position of Palace Master and he likely has a high status in the Xiao Family Clan too. But my current strength can’t be considered anything great right now, it just isn’t worth it for the Xiao Family Clan to bother with me. As for obtaining the source strength of the old Palace Master, how many people have managed to do so in the past several hundred years? But someone that has the potential to become the Palace Master only appears once every several tens of thousands of years. In my opinion, the Xiao Family Clan will be far more wary of a Divine Lord realm senior that supports Fairy Feng than a junior like me. Most importantly, the Xiao Family Clan is simply too large with too many matters that are occurring every day. When would they have the thoughts to bother with an ant-like existence like me? The current me doesn’t even have the qualifications to offend the Xiao Family Clan.”

“As for offending the Huang Family Clan, that is even more unworthy of mentioning. From the start that Huang Yuegong kept on talking like he was so seriously badass, saying that he wanted to introduce me to his family Elders or other such great kindnesses. But the truth is that if I really wanted to join some family clan, I have no need to seek his recommendation. With my talent, I believe anyone would eagerly accept me. In fact, Huang Yuegong recommending me might even bring him more merit in his family clan! Huang Yuegong’s background is truly wonderful, but most of what he says is bragging and blustering used to fool the disciples of common origin. His true status in the Huang Family Clan isn’t as high as Senior-apprentice Sister Jun thinks it is. The shame he received today from me is only a matter between the two of us, just like two little children fighting. How could an Elder of the Huang Family Clan kill another child just because their child was shamed by someone else’s child?”

Lin Ming calmly stated his analysis. As Jun Yunrue thought about it, this was also the truth. She hadn’t entered Phoenix Cry Palace for too long. She had no deep background, so she naturally felt a sense of fear towards the three great family clans, always believing that she couldn’t offend them. If anyone from one of the three great family clans approached the common disciples, the pressure was enough to make them bow their heads low.

In this sort of situation, Jun Yunrue was deceived by Huang Yuegong. When he made his threat, she had been afraid. She had worried for Lin Ming so she didn’t consider the overall situation too much. Now, after listening to Lin Ming’s reasoning, it seemed that her fears were unfounded.

“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, I never imagined that you would be someone from the lower realms. You just arrived in Phoenix Cry Palace and you have no foundation here, and with your fifth stage Life Destruction cultivation you were even threatened by Huang Yuegong. But not only were you not frightened or panicked, instead you even managed to see through his words. This senior-apprentice sister is really ashamed,” Jun Yunrue sincerely said. For a lower realms martial artist that had no background and was also new to the Divine Realm to stay exceedingly calm in the face of such a terrifying influence was extraordinary. He also managed to maintain his own position and interests while not touching their bottom line. This insight and poise was not something that just anybody had.

Lin Ming shook his head, “Senior-apprentice sister praises me too much. In the future I really will encounter a great deal of dangers, so I must be careful. Currently, Senior Fairy Feng alone should be enough to shelter me for some time. When Senior Fairy Feng and Sage Jiuyang’s battle reaches the superheating phase in the future, I should have the ability to protect myself.”

“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, no matter what you say, I must still thank you today for supporting Honorable Master Fairy Feng. If a disciple without much talent was recognized by Honorable Master Fairy Feng, then that would be their good fortune. But for someone like you that has talent, strength, and a mentality stronger than others, it would be easy to seek protection under any influence you wish. Even so, you chose to follow Honorable Master Fairy Feng. About today’s matters, I will report them to Honorable Master from beginning to end so that she can reward you.”

Jun Yunrue felt a bit apologetic toward Lin Ming. If Lin Ming chose not to support Fairy Feng and threw his chips in with Sage Jiuyang instead, then not only would he be in no danger in Phoenix Cry Palace, but he would have even more resources available to him than he already did. If he managed to enter Phoenix Hall in the future and break into the Divine Sea realm, he really could do whatever he wanted to.

But because he joined Fairy Feng, there were too many variables to account for. This would actually be a loss for Lin Ming.

Lin Ming said, “Senior-apprentice Sister Jun, you’re overstating things a bit too much. I’m someone that knows graciousness and knows how to repay it. Senior Fairy Feng recognized me in Timeworn Phoenix City and advised me. She left a lifesoul jade slip on me, and even spent a part of her cultivation to help my wives in the lower realms. Finally, she personally helped me ascend to the Divine Realm. If it weren’t for Senior Fairy Feng, I would’ve needed to waste a great deal of time and reach the Divine Sea before ascending.”

When Lin Ming reached the fifth stage of Life Destruction in the Sky Spill Continent, his destiny there already reached the pinnacle. In this case, if he had to wait until he reached the Divine Sea realm to ascend, he would have wasted a great deal of time.

……

The matter of Lin Ming obtaining the Phoenix Blood Spear didn’t spread out like a tide as Jun Yunrue had imagined. On the contrary, only very few people knew of it.

There weren’t many people that knew of this matter to begin with. The two lackeys that followed Huang Yuegong were imprisoned by Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit. As for Huang Yuegong himself, this was the greatest shame of his life and a major blow to his mentality. He certainly wouldn’t spread the news of such a disgraceful matter. Instead, he immediately returned to his palace and holed himself up in seclusion, disappearing from the public eye.

As for Song Baifeng, he was scared silent. He was well aware that Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit supported Lin Ming, so spreading out any information was only something that would happen if he was tired of living. Song Baifeng certainly knew of the dangers of ‘loose lips sinks ships’, and while it was possible for him to obtain some benefits from revealing what he knew, it was incomparable to the future dangers he might suffer. When anyone asked Song Baifeng, he simply stated that he didn’t know anything. Not just that, but he even made a sacrifice and allowed the other young disciples following Jun Yunrue to freely select a low-grade saint artifact.

But paper can’t be used to wrap fire. The disciples that entered Saint Artifact Pavilion after soon discovered that one of the nine top grade saint artifacts, the Phoenix Blood Spear, had disappeared, and in its place was now a halberd. Although the halberd was also a top grade saint artifact, the quality was far inferior to the Phoenix Blood Spear.

In other words, that meant someone had taken the Phoenix Blood Spear!

The spear had hung within Saint Artifact Pavilion for over 30 years, and was faintly recognized as the top saint artifact of Saint Artifact Pavilion, surpassing even the Sunpierce Sword and Sun Shooting Bow. But that spear was now taken away by someone!

The news quickly spread. But no one knew just who had acquired the Phoenix Blood Spear.

The Divine Lord realm figures as well as the various Hall Masters and Elders didn’t care about such a minor matter. But to the young disciples of Vermillion Bird Hall and Phoenix Hall, this was an explosive situation!
